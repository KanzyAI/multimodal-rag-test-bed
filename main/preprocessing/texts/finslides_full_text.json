Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity.

Expected Return on Assets (WW) slightly decreased from 7.4% in 2009 to 7.3% in 2010, while Actual Return on Assets (WW) also saw a minor decline from 11.8% to 11.7%. The Discount Rate (WW) decreased from 5.2% to 4.7% over the same period, reflecting changes in interest rate environments impacting pension liabilities valuation.

The lower chart, \"Retirement-Related Cash Drivers ($B)\", depicts consistent cash outflows, ranging from ($1.7B) in 2009 to a projected ($1.3B) in 2015, highlighting the ongoing liquidity impact of retirement obligations. The data includes both historical actuals and future projections, providing insight into the long-term financial burden and volatility of pension-related expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nComprehensive bar charts presenting IBM's pre-tax retirement-related cost/income and cash drivers in billions of dollars, distinguishing between actual results for 2009-2010 and projections through 2015 based on December 2010 assumptions for tax-qualified defined benefit plans. The \"Pre-Tax Retirement-Related (Cost) / Income ($B)\" chart indicates a transition from pre-tax income (e.g., $0.5B in 2009) to a projected cost by 2012-2014, with a peak cost of ($0.7B) in 2013, before returning to a projected income of $0.1B in 2015. Concurrently, the \"Retirement-Related Cash Drivers ($B)\" chart consistently shows significant cash outflows, ranging from ($1.7B) in 2009 to projected ($1.3B) in 2014-2015, underscoring the substantial and sustained cash flow impact of these benefit plans on the company's financials.\n\n"

As of 1Q12, the portfolio holds $25.1 billion in Net External Receivables, with 62% classified as Investment Grade (24% Aaa-A3, 38% Baa1-Baa3) and 38% as Non-Investment Grade (22% Ba1-Ba2, 10% Ba3-B1, 5% B2-B3, and 1% Caa-D). The table shows an Identified Loss Rate of 0.8% and an Anticipated Loss Rate of 0.5% for 1Q12, with Reserve Coverage at 1.3%, while Commercial A/R > 30 Days increased to $68 million in 1Q12 from $25 million in 1Q11. The data provides a quarterly comparison across 1Q12, 4Q11, and 1Q11 for loss rates, reserve coverage, and delinquent receivables, indicating trends over the past year. This distribution highlights a strong majority of the portfolio in Investment Grade, and the detailed metrics provide insight into the credit risk management and performance of the financing receivables, showing an increase in aged commercial receivables in 1Q12 compared to previous quarters.

Key metrics include external revenue of $1.6 billion, down 21% year-over-year, and a PTI of $0.1 billion, a 45% year-over-year decrease. Gross Margin (External) was 51.1% (down 4.8 percentage points), and PTI Margin was 7.8% (down 3.5 percentage points). Segment revenue elements show declines in Operating Systems Software (11% year-over-year) and Systems Hardware (25% year-over-year). Strategic Imperatives revenue within Systems was $0.7 billion (down 18% year-over-year), with Cloud revenue at $0.5 billion (down 16% year-over-year). All financial data and changes are reported for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year. The segment highlights indicate that z Systems performance was influenced by product cycles, leading to revenue decline but margin expansion. The Power business was impacted by a decline in Unix, while transitioning to Linux, and storage value continues to shift towards software. Gross Margin expansion in z Systems was offset by performance in Power and Storage, contributing to the overall revenue and profit decline in the Systems Segment.

PTI margin was 4.5% (down 8.7 percentage points). Segment revenue elements like Application Management, Consulting, and Global Process Services all show year-over-year declines of 1% or 4%. Conversely, Strategic Imperatives revenue within Global Business Services reached $2.0 billion (up 22% year-over-year), with Cloud revenue at $0.6 billion (up 55% year-over-year), and an as-a-Service exit run rate of $0.5 billion. The data covers the first quarter of 2016 (1Q16), with year-over-year (Yr/Yr) comparisons. Despite overall declines in the Global Business Services segment's traditional metrics, there is strong growth in strategic areas like Cloud and other Strategic Imperatives, indicating a business transformation towards higher-growth, more modern service offerings. This aligns with the highlights mentioning the shift to strategic imperatives and expansion of digital design capabilities.

The left panel presents tabular data for Global Technology Services (GTS) and Global Business Services (GBS) showing 2Q15 external revenue, gross margin, and PTI margin, along with year-over-year (Yr/Yr) changes. GTS reported $8.1B in revenue with 1% Yr/Yr growth, while GBS revenue was $4.3B, declining 3% Yr/Yr. Both segments experienced margin compression, with GTS gross margin at 36.6% (down 2.3 pts) and PTI margin at 15.1% (down 2.9 pts), and GBS gross margin at 27.4% (down 2.4 pts) and PTI margin at 14.7% (down 5.3 pts). The lower left section details 2Q15 Yr/Yr revenue growth for GTS sub-segments (GTS Outsourcing 1%, Integrated Technology Services 1%, Maintenance 2%) and GBS sub-segments (GBS Outsourcing Flat, Consulting & Systems Integration -4%). IBM's backlog stood at $122B, increasing 1% Yr/Yr. The right panel features a pie chart illustrating the 2Q15 Revenue (% of Total Services), with GTS Outsourcing contributing the largest share at 35%, followed by GBS Consulting & Systems Integration at 25%, Integrated Technology Services (ITS) at 17%, Maintenance at 13%, and GBS Outsourcing at 10%.

Americas reported $9.9 billion in revenue, experiencing a (5%) reported decline and (4%) decline at constant currency. Europe/ME/A generated $7.8 billion, with a significant (12%) reported decline and (6%) decline at constant currency. Asia Pacific recorded $5.2 billion, showing flat reported growth but a (4%) decline at constant currency. Total Geographies revenue stood at $22.9 billion, marking a (7%) reported and (5%) constant currency decline. IBM's total revenue was $23.6 billion, also declining (7%) reported and (5%) at constant currency. Further segmentation shows Major Markets declining (7%) reported and (6%) @CC, Growth Markets declining (6%) reported and (1%) @CC, while BRIC Countries, despite a (1%) reported decline, achieved 4% growth at constant currency, indicating stronger performance in emerging economies.\n\n\n\n# Revenue by Geography\n\n|  $ in Billions | 3Q09 | B/(W) Yr/Yr Rptd | Yr/Yr @CC  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Americas | $9.9 | (5%) | (4%)  |\n|  Europe/ME/A | 7.8 | (12%) | (6%)  |\n|  Asia Pacific | 5.2 | Flat | (4%)  |\n|  Total Geographies | $22.9 | (7%) | (5%)  |\n|  IBM | $23.6 | (7%) | (5%)  |\n|  Major Markets |  | (7%) | (6%)  |\n|  Growth Markets |  | (6%) | (1%)  |\n|  BRIC Countries |  | (1%) | 4%  |\n\n\n\nThe image presents a pie chart illustrating IBM's revenue distribution by geography, along with select year-over-year constant currency (@CC) growth rates.

The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Current Item (Workforce Rebalancing)\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of certain charges in connection with workforce rebalancing actions. Management believes that presenting certain financial information without this item is more representative of the company's operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. Effective January 1, 2011, the company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Income Tax Settlement\n\nManagement presents free cash flow excluding the effects of certain income tax settlement payments. Management believes that presenting free cash flow without this item is more representative of the company's operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. Effective January 1, 2011, the company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

The Margin Expansion component is further detailed, showing a positive Gross Margin impact of $0.23, offset by a negative Expense E/R impact of $(0.17) and a negative Tax impact of $(0.03). This analysis highlights the combined effect of operational performance and capital allocation strategies on per-share earnings over the year.\n\n\n\n# Operating EPS Bridge \u2013 3Q10 to 3Q11\n\n\n\nThis segment of an Operating EPS bridge chart details the contributions of Margin Expansion, Share Repurchases, and the resulting 3Q11 Operating EPS. Specifically, Margin Expansion contributed $0.03, with an underlying breakdown of $0.23 from Gross Margin, $(0.17) from Expense E/R, and $(0.03) from Tax. Share Repurchases added $0.18 to the EPS, culminating in a 3Q11 Operating EPS of $3.28.

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Retail Store Solutions (RSS) Divestiture\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba Tec for the sale of its RSS business to Toshiba Tec. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the RSS divestiture. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/ losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year's currency conversion rate. This consistent approach is based on the pricing currency for each country which is typically the functional currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders."

The 1Q18 EPS of $2.45 decreased to $2.25 in 1Q19, primarily due to a substantial negative impact from tax of $(0.73) and a minor headwind from revenue of $(0.10). This decline occurred despite a significant positive contribution from pre-tax margin expansion of $0.55, which, along with the tax effect, constitutes operating leverage. A positive impact of $0.08 from shares partially offset these headwinds.

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Customer Care Outsourcing and System x Business Divestiture\n\nOn September 10, 2013, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with SYNNEX for the sale of IBM's worldwide customer care process outsourcing services business and on January 23, 2014, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Lenovo for the sale of IBM's x86 server business. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the customer care process outsourcing services business and/or the x86 server business divestitures. Management believes that presenting financial information without either or both of these items is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisitionrelated charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because we believe this is more representative of the company's core business operations."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Retail Store Solutions (RSS) Divestiture\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba Tec for the sale of its RSS business to Toshiba Tec. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the RSS divestiture. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors.\n\n## Workforce Rebalancing\n\nOn April 18, 2013, the company announced it expected to take most of its workforce rebalancing actions for 2013 in the second quarter as compared to 2012 when these actions were distributed across the four quarters of the year. The company took a $\\$ 1$ billion workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter. Management believes that presenting certain financial information without this item is most indicative of operational trajectory."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. Effective January 1, 2011, the company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Unique Items (PLM Sale and/or Workforce Rebalancing)\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the company's PLM sale and/or workforce rebalancing. In March 2010, the company completed the sale of its activities associated with the sales and support of Dassault Systemes' (Dassault) product lifecycle management (PLM) software, including customer contracts and related assets to Dassault. In addition, the company has taken certain charges in connection with workforce rebalancing actions. Management believes that presenting certain financial information without one or both of these items is more representative of the company's operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors."

Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year's currency conversion rate. This consistent approach is based on the pricing currency for each country which is typically the functional currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders."

A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## PLM Sale\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the PLM sale. In March 2010, the company completed the sale of its activities associated with the sales and support of Dassault Systemes' (Dassault) product lifecycle management (PLM) software, including customer contracts and related assets to Dassault.

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/ losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

        "text": "\n\nFinancial Content Type: Bar chart illustrating historical and projected Earnings Per Share (EPS) alongside key business performance highlights. Quantitative Details: EPS values are $6.06 for 2006, $7.18 for 2007, and $8.50+ for 2008, with a projected range of $10-$11 for 2010. Year-over-year EPS growth for 2008 is indicated as 18% (with an asterisk for a footnote), and the projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2006 to 2010 is 14%-16%. Temporal Context: The chart covers actual EPS data for 2006, 2007, and 2008, and provides a forward-looking projection for 2010, indicating a consistent upward trend in EPS. The data pertains to a '1Q 2008 Wrap-Up'. Business Intelligence: The accompanying bullet points detail drivers of performance, including strong revenue and profit performance in Services, a successful z10 launch for Systems & Technology, enhanced Software capabilities via the Cognos acquisition, double-digit growth in Growth Markets, improved U.S. performance, and overall financial strength and flexibility. These factors underpin the observed EPS growth.

Quantitative Details: The first footnote clarifies an EPS growth rate of '19% Yr/Yr excluding 2007 Printer Gain,' which likely provides the unadjusted growth rate referenced in the main chart's 18%* figure. The second statement highlights a significant '36% EPS growth' achieved by a strong operating model. Temporal Context: The footnote specifically references a '2007 Printer Gain,' providing a temporal adjustment context for the 2008 EPS growth calculation. The 36% EPS growth statement relates to the overall period covered by the 1Q 2008 wrap-up. Business Intelligence: These footnotes offer crucial details for accurate financial analysis, indicating adjustments made to reported growth rates and emphasizing the company's strong operational performance as a driver for substantial EPS growth. They provide important qualifiers for the presented financial metrics.

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Retail Store Solutions (RSS) Divestiture\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba Tec for the sale of its RSS business to Toshiba Tec. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the RSS divestiture. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors.\n\n## Workforce Rebalancing\n\nOn April 18, 2013, the company announced it expected to take most of its workforce rebalancing actions for 2013 in the second quarter as compared to 2012 when these actions were distributed across the four quarters of the year. The company took a $\\$ 1$ billion workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter. Management believes that presenting certain financial information without this item is most indicative of operational trajectory."

Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity.

The rationale for management's use of this non-GAAP information is included as Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K submitted to the SEC on July 19, 2023. The reconciliation of non-GAAP information to GAAP is included in the press release within Exhibit 99.1 to the company's Form 8-K submitted to the SEC on July 19, 2023, as well as on the slides entitled \"Non-GAAP supplemental materials\" in this presentation.\n\nTo provide better transparency, the company also discusses management performance metrics including annual recurring revenue, signings, and book-tobill. The metrics are used to monitor the performance of the business and are viewed as useful decision-making information for management and stakeholders. The rationale for management's use of these performance metrics and their calculation are included in the Management Discussion section of the company's 2022 Annual Report, which is Exhibit 13 to the Form 10-K submitted with the SEC on February 28, 2023.

For the fourth quarter of 2008 (4Q08), IBM reported total revenue of $27.0 billion, a (6%) decline year-over-year (Y/Y) on a reported basis and (1%) at constant currency. Key contributors include Financial Services with $7.9 billion (down 6% reported, 1% at CC), Small/Medium Business (SMB) with $5.1 billion (down 9% reported, 3% at CC), and Public sector with $4.2 billion (down 1% reported, up 5% at CC). The data specifically covers the fourth quarter of 2008, providing year-over-year percentage changes for both reported and constant currency revenues across all industry units, offering insight into short-term performance trends. The revenue decline across most sectors, notably Financial Services and SMB, indicates a challenging economic environment in late 2008, consistent with the overall IBM revenue decline. The Public sector's positive growth at constant currency (5%) stands out as a relatively resilient area. The 'All Sectors' total of $26.4 billion is distinct from the 'Total IBM' figure, suggesting other revenue streams not detailed in the industry sales units. Retrieval Keywords: IBM revenue, 4Q08 financial results, industry sales unit revenue, financial services revenue, public sector revenue, industrial revenue, distribution revenue, communications revenue, small medium business revenue, year-over-year growth, constant currency revenue, revenue breakdown.\n\n"

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and/or earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings\n\nManagement presents operating (Non-GAAP) earnings, excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and their related tax impacts. For acquisitions, operating earnings excludes the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as inprocess research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related cost includes interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of operating earnings, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share road map, the company will utilize operating earnings to establish its objectives and track its progress."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-toperiod comparisons of the company's business performance. Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year's currency conversion rate. This consistent approach is based on the pricing currency for each country which is typically the functional currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## PLM Sale\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the PLM divestiture. In March 2010, the company completed the sale of its activities associated with the sales and support of Dassault Systemes' (Dassault) product lifecycle management (PLM) software, including customer contracts and related assets to Dassault. Given this sale, management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue and software segment revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Workforce Rebalancing\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of charges in connection with workforce rebalancing actions. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding pre-tax income, pre-tax income margin, and SG\\&A expense without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors.\n\n## Retail Store Solutions (RSS) Divestiture\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba Tec for the sale of its RSS business to Toshiba Tec. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the company completed the latest phase of the sale of its RSS business. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the RSS divestiture. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year's currency conversion rate. This consistent approach is based on the pricing currency for each country which is typically the functional currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations."

The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Other Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the following items: (1) certain income tax settlement payments, (2) the PLM divestiture (representing the March 2010 sale of IBM activities associated with the sales and support of Dassault Systemes' product lifecycle management (PLM) software, including customer contracts and related assets, to Dassault), (3) workforce rebalancing charges, and (4) Japan and Public Sector results. Management believes that presenting certain financial information without these items is more representative of the company's operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors."

The chart shows a shift from pre-tax income in earlier years ($0.5B in 2009, $0.4B in 2010, $0.1B in 2011) to pre-tax costs starting in 2012 ($0.4B), increasing to ($0.8B) in 2013, and then decreasing to ($0.4B) in 2014 and ($0.0B) in 2015. This indicates a worsening financial impact from retirement-related items in the middle of the period, with an improvement towards neutral by 2015.

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. Effective January 1, 2011, the company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Customer Care Outsourcing and System x Business Divestiture\n\nWith respect to the sale of IBM's worldwide customer care outsourcing services business to SYNNEX, the initial closing date was January 31, 2014. With respect to the sale of IBM's x86 server business to Lenovo, the initial closing date was October 1, 2014. Management believes that presenting financial information without either or both of these items is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisitionrelated charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

The rationale for management's use of this non-GAAP information is included as Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K submitted to the SEC on October 19, 2022. The reconciliation of non-GAAP information to GAAP is included in the press release within Exhibit 99.1 to the company's Form 8-K submitted to the SEC on October 19, 2022, as well as on the slides entitled \"Non-GAAP supplemental materials\" in this presentation.\n\nTo provide better transparency, the company also discusses management performance metrics including hybrid cloud revenue, annual recurring revenue, signings, and book-to-bill. The metrics are used to monitor the performance of the business and are viewed as useful decision-making information for management and stakeholders. The rationale for management's use of these performance metrics and their calculation are included in the Management Discussion section of the company's 2021 Annual Report, which is Exhibit 13 to the Form 10-K submitted with the SEC on February 22, 2022.

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and/or earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year's currency conversion rate. This consistent approach is based on the pricing currency for each country which is typically the functional currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## PLM Sale\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the PLM sale. In March 2010, the company completed the sale of its activities associated with the sales and support of Dassault Systemes' (Dassault) product lifecycle management (PLM) software, including customer contracts and related assets to Dassault. Given this sale, management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue and software segment revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Customer Care Outsourcing and System x Business Divestiture\n\nOn September 10, 2013, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with SYNNEX for the sale of IBM's worldwide customer care process outsourcing services business and on January 23, 2014, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Lenovo for the sale of IBM's x86 server business. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the customer care process outsourcing services business and/or the x86 server business divestitures. Management believes that presenting financial information without either or both of these items is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisitionrelated charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Effective Tax Rate\n\nManagement presents the company's effective tax rate excluding the effects of a one-time tax benefit. Management believes this measure is more representative of the company's ongoing effective tax rate and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future effective tax rates, which may be more useful for investors."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. Effective January 1, 2011, the company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders."

A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisitionrelated charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Customer Care Outsourcing and System x Business Divestiture\n\nWith respect to the sale of IBM's worldwide customer care outsourcing services business to SYNNEX, the initial closing date was January 31, 2014. With respect to the sale of IBM's x86 server business to Lenovo, the initial closing date was October 1, 2014. Management believes that presenting financial information without either or both of these items is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders."

These charts and the associated remarks and comments are integrally related, and are intended to be presented and understood together.\n\nIn an effort to provide additional and useful information regarding the company's financial results and other financial information as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, certain non-GAAP information including \"operating earnings\", other \"operating\" financial measures, including free cash flow, net cash from operating activities excluding Global Financing receivables, and adjustments for currency. The rationale for management's use of this nonGAAP information is included as Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 17, 2019. The reconciliation of non-GAAP information to GAAP is included on the slides entitled \"Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials\" in this presentation, as well as in Exhibit 99.1 to the company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 17, 2019.

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nCash Flow\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\nDebt-to-Capital Ratio\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multiemployer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

Forward-looking statements are based on the company's current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. Those statements by their nature address matters that are uncertain to different degrees. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM web site, or from IBM Investor Relations. Any forward-looking statement made during this presentation speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. These charts and the associated remarks and comments are integrally related, and are intended to be presented and understood together.\nIn an effort to provide additional and useful information regarding the company's financial results and other financial information as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, certain non-GAAP information including \"operating earnings\" and other \"operating\" financial measures. The rationale for management's use of this non-GAAP information, the reconciliation of that information to GAAP, and other related information are included in supplemental materials entitled \"Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials\" that are posted on the Company's investor relations web site at http://www.ibm.com/investor/3q12/ The Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials are also included as Attachment II to the Company's Form 8-K dated October 16, 2012."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Workforce Rebalancing\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of charges in connection with workforce rebalancing actions. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding pre-tax income, pre-tax income margin, and SG\\&A expense without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors.\n\n## Retail Store Solutions (RSS) divestiture\n\nIn the third quarter, the company completed the first two phases of the sale of its RSS business. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the RSS divestiture. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Customer Care Outsourcing and System x Business Divestiture\n\nWith respect to the sale of IBM's worldwide customer care outsourcing services business to SYNNEX, the initial closing date was January 31, 2014. With respect to the sale of IBM's x86 server business to Lenovo, the initial closing date was October 1, 2014. Management believes that presenting financial information without either or both of these items is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisitionrelated charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. Effective January 1, 2011, the company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and/or earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations."

The PTI Margin % (green line) shows an overall upward trajectory, while EPS (red line) demonstrates a significant increase, particularly from 2002 onwards.

Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Customer Care Outsourcing Business Divestiture\n\nOn September 10, 2013, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with SYNNEX for the sale of its worldwide customer care process outsourcing services business. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the customer care outsourcing business divestiture. Management believes that presenting financial information without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

        "text": "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Workforce Rebalancing\n\nOn April 18, 2013, the company announced it expected to take most of its workforce rebalancing actions for 2013 in the second quarter as compared to 2012 when these actions were distributed across the four quarters of the year. The company took $\\$ 1$ billion workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter. Management believes that presenting certain financial information without this item is most indicative of operational trajectory."
