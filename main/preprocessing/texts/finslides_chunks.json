The commitment to \"Increase investment\" implies significant capital allocation towards growth engines, impacting future R&D, CAPEX, or M&A spending. Furthermore, \"Optimize capital structure\" indicates a focus on financial efficiency, potentially involving debt refinancing, share repurchases, or dividend policy adjustments to enhance shareholder value.

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-toperiod comparisons of the company's business performance. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders."

The slide presents comparative tables for Global Technology Services (GTS) and Global Business Services (GBS), detailing revenue, gross margin, pre-tax income (PTI), and PTI margin, along with year-over-year changes both reported and at constant currency. GTS reported $9.5 billion in external revenue, down 5% reported and 2% at constant currency, with a gross margin of 37.8% (up 1.5 pts) and a PTI margin of 15.4% (down 1.7 pts), or 19.0% (up 1.3 pts) excluding WFR. GBS recorded $4.6 billion in external revenue, down 1% reported but up 2% at constant currency, with a gross margin of 31.2% (up 0.4 pts) and a PTI margin of 13.0% (down 3.6 pts), or 17.9% (up 0.5 pts) excluding WFR. The Services Backlog stood at $141 billion, increasing 3% reported and 7% at constant currency. A pie chart illustrates the 2Q13 revenue breakdown by percentage of total services, showing GTS Outsourcing as the largest component at 39%, followed by GBS Consulting & Systems Integration at 25%, Integrated Technology Services (ITS) at 16%, Maintenance at 13%, and GBS Outsourcing at 7%. The slide highlights continued backlog growth and gross margin expansion.\n\n"

The portfolio is segmented into 59% Investment Grade and 41% Non-Investment Grade, providing a clear breakdown of credit risk exposure. Within the Investment Grade category, Aaa-A3 ratings comprise 32% and Baa1-Baa3 ratings represent 27% of the total receivables. For the Non-Investment Grade portion, Ba1-Ba2 accounts for 21%, Ba3-B1 for 12%, B2-B3 for 6%, and Caa-C for 2%, detailing the granular risk profile of the external receivables. This visualization is critical for assessing the overall credit risk and asset quality of the company's financing portfolio.\n\n\n\n# Global Financing Portfolio\n\n## 4Q08 - $26.1B External Receivables\n\n\n\nThe table provides a comparative analysis of key financial metrics for IBM's financing portfolio between 4Q08 and 4Q07, highlighting trends in loss rates, reserve coverage, and delinquency. The Identified Loss Rate increased from 0.8% in 4Q07 to 1.4% in 4Q08, while the Anticipated Loss Rate also rose slightly from 0.5% to 0.6% over the same period, indicating a potential increase in credit losses. Correspondingly, Reserve Coverage was strengthened significantly from 1.3% in 4Q07 to 2.0% in 4Q08, suggesting a more conservative provisioning for potential losses. Positively, Client Days Delinquent Outstanding improved from 3.6 days to 3.2 days, and the value of Commercial A/R > 30 Days decreased substantially from $61 million to $41 million, reflecting better collection efficiency despite the higher loss rates.\n\n\n\n|   | 4Q08 | 4Q07  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Identified Loss Rate | 1.4% | 0.8%  |\n|  Anticipated Loss Rate | 0.6% | 0.5%  |\n|  Reserve Coverage | 2.0% | 1.3%  |\n|  Client Days Delinquent Outstanding | 3.2 | 3.6  |\n|  Commercial A/R > 30 Days | $41M | $61M  |\n\nwww.ibm.com/investor"

On the right, a stacked bar chart illustrates 'Services Run Out' for 2011 and 2012.

For 2012, projected revenue from the 12/31/11 backlog is approximately $43B, indicating a 3% year-over-year growth in revenue from backlog. The chart also includes a legend for Revenue from New Signings, Revenue from Base Growth, and Revenue from Backlog.

For 3Q08, Global Technology Services reported $9.9 billion in external revenue, growing 8% reported and 5% at constant currency, with a gross margin of 32.7% and PTI margin of 11.6%. Global Business Services recorded $4.9 billion in external revenue, up 7% reported and 3% at constant currency, achieving a 27.4% gross margin and 14.0% PTI margin. Total Services PTI grew 23% year-over-year, driven by 16% growth in GTS and 39% in GBS. Global Services total signings declined 4% year-over-year to $12.7 billion on an actual currency basis, and 5% at constant currency to $11.1 billion, with long-term signings experiencing a significant decline. The 3Q08 Services revenue mix shows Strategic Outsourcing as the largest component at 34% (+8% YoY), followed by Global Business Services at 33% (+7% YoY), Integrated Technology Services at 16% (+6% YoY), Maintenance at 12% (+14% YoY), and BTO at 4%. All financial figures and growth rates are presented for the third quarter of 2008, with year-over-year comparisons indicating performance trends. Despite a reported decline in total services signings, IBM's Services segments demonstrated strong profitability growth in Q3 2008, with significant year-over-year increases in PTI for both GTS and GBS, suggesting effective cost management or higher-margin service delivery. The pie chart highlights the dominant contributions of Strategic Outsourcing and Global Business Services to total services revenue.

Key positive drivers included Revenue Growth contributing $0.10, Pre-Tax Margin expansion adding $0.04, and Shares contributing $0.05. Operating leverage, excluding significant items, was $0.02, resulting from the combined effect of pre-tax margin expansion and a headwind from the annual tax rate (-$0.02). Significant items, primarily a headwind of $0.05, were influenced by actions to reposition the business (-$0.41 EPS impact) partially offset by discrete tax benefits (+$0.35 EPS impact). Underlying dynamics supporting this growth include nominal revenue growth, improving gross margin trajectory, and operating PTI margin expansion, leading to high-single digit operating EPS growth.\n\n\n\nSum of the components may not add due to the use of rounded numbers\n\n|  1Q17 | Revenue Growth\n@Actual | Pre-Tax\nMargin\n(Expansion) | Annual\nTax Rate\n(Headwind) | Shares | Significant\nItems\n(Headwind) | 1Q18  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Underlying Dynamics: |  |  | Significant Items* | 1Q18 | B/(W)\nYr/Yr | EPS\nYr/Yr  |\n|  - Nominal revenue growth @CC |  |  | Actions to continue to\nreposition business (pre-tax) | ($613M) | ($446M) | ($0.41)  |\n|  - Gross margin trajectory improving |  |  | Discrete tax benefits (tax) | $810M | $315M | $0.35  |\n|  - Operating PTI margin expansion |  |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  - High-single digit operating EPS growth |  |  |  |  |  |   |"

Starting with an Operating EPS of $2.94 in 2017, the company saw positive contributions of $0.10 from revenue and $0.20 from pre-tax margin, along with a $0.07 increase attributable to shares. However, a significant tax headwind resulted in a $(0.22) reduction in EPS, leading to a final Operating EPS of $3.08 in 2018. The chart highlights the combined impact of pre-tax margin and tax as 'Operating Leverage,' and the overall change reflects a mid-single digit EPS growth as noted in the accompanying text.\n\n\n\n- Growth in revenue, operating gross profit, pre-tax income\n- Solid pre-tax operating leverage\n- Significant tax headwind driven by 2Q17 discrete tax benefit\n- Mid-single digit EPS growth\n\nSum of the components may not add due to the use of rounded numbers"

During the first quarter of 2020, the company realigned offerings and the related management system to reflect divestitures completed in the second half of 2019 and tighter integration of certain industry-related consulting services. Accordingly, IBM is updating its Cloud \\& Cognitive Software segment, Global Business Services segment and the Other - divested businesses category in the first quarter of 2020 and recasting historical information in these areas for consistency with the go-forward performance. To provide some context of the magnitude of these changes, total recast revenue in 2019 is approximately $\\$ 0.3$ billion of IBM's total $\\$ 77$ billion. There is no change to the Global Technology Services, Systems, or Global Financing segments, and there is no impact to IBM's consolidated results.\n\n|  Management System Change | Resulting Segment Implications  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Divestitures of IBM's risk analytics and regulatory | - Cloud \\& Cognitive Software (Cognitive Applications)  |\n|  offerings and sales performance management offerings |   |\n|   | + Other - divested businesses  |\n|  Realignment of certain industry-related consulting | - Cloud \\& Cognitive Software (Cognitive Applications)  |\n|  offerings to the Global Business Services segment |   |\n|   | + Global Business Services (Consulting)  |\n\nThese changes are effective in the first quarter of 2020.

The metrics are used to monitor the performance of the business and are viewed as useful decision-making information for management and stakeholders.

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Current Item (Workforce Rebalancing)\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of certain charges in connection with workforce rebalancing actions. Management believes that presenting certain financial information without this item is more representative of the company's operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. Effective January 1, 2011, the company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Income Tax Settlement\n\nManagement presents free cash flow excluding the effects of certain income tax settlement payments. Management believes that presenting free cash flow without this item is more representative of the company's operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. Effective January 1, 2011, the company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Retail Store Solutions (RSS) Divestiture\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba Tec for the sale of its RSS business to Toshiba Tec. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the RSS divestiture. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

The segment reported $4.5 billion in external revenue in 3Q11, growing 4% year-over-year (1% at constant currency), with a gross margin of 39.8% (up 3.4 points) and pre-tax income of $0.3 billion (up 8%). PTI margin stood at 6.8%, an increase of 0.3 points. Within 3Q11 revenue, Power Systems showed strong growth at 15% (12% at constant currency), while Storage grew 8% (5% at constant currency) and Retail Store Solutions grew 14% (11% at constant currency). Total Systems revenue increased by 6% (2% at constant currency). The revenue composition pie chart shows Servers accounted for 64% of the segment's revenue, Storage for 19%, and Microelectronics OEM for 14%. All data pertains to the third quarter of 2011, with year-over-year growth rates provided for both reported and constant currency figures, allowing for a clear temporal comparison. The segment demonstrated overall revenue growth and improved profitability in 3Q11, driven by strong performance in Power Systems, Storage, and Retail Store Solutions, despite declines in System z and Microelectronics OEM. The significant contribution of Servers to the segment's revenue highlights their importance, while the growth in Power Systems supports the statement of extending Unix leadership.

Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/ losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and/or earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year's currency conversion rate. This consistent approach is based on the pricing currency for each country which is typically the functional currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders."

Starting from an EPS of $2.45 in 1Q18, the company experienced a ($0.10) headwind from Revenue @Actual and a significant ($0.73) impact from Tax, partially offset by a positive $0.55 contribution from Pre-Tax Margin and $0.08 from Shares, resulting in a 1Q19 EPS of $2.25. The overall change in EPS was a decrease of $0.20 year-over-year.

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Unique Items\n\nManagement presents certain segment financial results excluding the effects of the following items: (1) PLM gain in 2010, (2) Geodis gain in 2009 and (3) Workforce Rebalancing in both 2009 and 2010. Given the unique nature of these items, management believes that presenting certain segment financial information without these items is more representative of the segment's operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors."

Forwardlooking statements are based on the company's current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. Those statements by their nature address matters that are uncertain to different degrees. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from IBM Investor Relations. Any forward-looking statement made during this presentation speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law; these charts and the associated remarks and comments are integrally related and are intended to be presented and understood together.\n\nIn an effort to provide additional and useful information regarding the company's financial results and other financial information as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and presentation materials, certain non-GAAP information including operating earnings and other \"operating\" financial measures, free cash flow, net cash from operating activities excluding IBM Financing receivables, and\nadjustments for currency. The rationale for management's use of this non-GAAP information is included as Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K submitted to the SEC on October 25, 2023. The reconciliation of non-GAAP information to GAAP is included in the press release within Exhibit 99.1 to the company's Form 8-K submitted to the SEC on October 25, 2023, as well as on the slides entitled \"Non-GAAP supplemental materials\" in this presentation.\n\nTo provide better transparency, the company also discusses management performance metrics including annual recurring revenue, signings, and book-tobill. The metrics are used to monitor the performance of the business and are viewed as useful decision-making information for management and stakeholders. The rationale for management's use of these performance metrics and their calculation are included in the Management Discussion section of the company's 2022 Annual Report, which is Exhibit 13 to the Form 10-K submitted with the SEC on February 28, 2023.

This is helping drive solid growth in our software and consulting businesses. As a result, we remain confident in our revenue and free cash flow growth expectations for the full year.\"\n\n**Arvind Krishna**\n*IBM Chairman and CEO*\n\n\n\nThe icon illustrates IBM's 3Q23 performance, reflecting the company's financial results for the third quarter of 2023. This aligns with the CEO's statement on solid growth in software and consulting businesses and confidence in revenue and free cash flow growth expectations for the full year. The visual represents key performance indicators for the quarter, indicating positive trends in line with the financial presentation for the period.\n\n\n\n3Q23 Performance\n\n\n\nThe icon represents IBM's strategic focus on Generative AI, particularly through its watsonx AI and data platform, which clients are increasingly adopting. This adoption is a key driver for unlocking productivity and operational efficiency, directly contributing to the solid growth observed in IBM's software and consulting businesses. The visual signifies a critical technological advancement and its impact on IBM's financial performance and market positioning.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI\n\n\n\nThe icon signifies IBM's emphasis on innovation, portfolio optimization, and productivity as core drivers of its financial performance and competitive differentiation. This strategic focus is instrumental in achieving the outlined productivity and operational efficiency, which in turn fuels solid growth in revenue and free cash flow.

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Customer Care Outsourcing and System x Business Divestiture\n\nOn September 10, 2013, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with SYNNEX for the sale of IBM's worldwide customer care process outsourcing services business and on January 23, 2014, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Lenovo for the sale of IBM's x86 server business. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the customer care process outsourcing services business and/or the x86 server business divestitures. Management believes that presenting financial information without either or both of these items is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisitionrelated charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 .

The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Retail Store Solutions (RSS) Divestiture\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba Tec for the sale of its RSS business to Toshiba Tec. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the RSS divestiture. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors.\n\n## Workforce Rebalancing\n\nOn April 18, 2013, the company announced it expected to take most of its workforce rebalancing actions for 2013 in the second quarter as compared to 2012 when these actions were distributed across the four quarters of the year. The company took a $\\$ 1$ billion workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter. Management believes that presenting certain financial information without this item is most indicative of operational trajectory."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

Forwardlooking statements are based on the company's current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. Those statements by their nature address matters that are uncertain to different degrees. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from IBM Investor Relations. Statements in this communication regarding IBM and HashiCorp that are forward-looking may include projections as to closing date for the transaction, the extent of, and the time necessary to obtain, the regulatory approvals required for the transaction, the anticipated benefits of the transaction, the impact of the transaction on IBM's business, the synergies from the transaction or the combined company's future operating results. Any forward-looking statement made during this presentation speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law; these charts and the associated remarks and comments are integrally related and are intended to be presented and understood together.\n\nIn an effort to provide additional and useful information regarding the company's financial results and other financial information as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its\nearnings press release and presentation materials, certain non-GAAP information including operating earnings and other \"operating\" financial measures, free cash flow, net cash from operating activities excluding IBM Financing receivables, adjusted EBITDA and adjustments for currency. The rationale for management's use of this non-GAAP information is included as Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K submitted to the SEC on April 24, 2024. The reconciliation of nonGAAP information to GAAP is included in the press release within Exhibit 99.1 to the company's Form 8-K submitted to the SEC on April 24, 2024, as well as on the slides entitled \"Non-GAAP supplemental materials\" in this presentation.\n\nTo provide better transparency, the company also discusses management performance metrics including annual recurring revenue, annual bookings, signings, and book-to-bill. The metrics are used to monitor the performance of the business and are viewed as useful decision-making information for management and stakeholders. The rationale for management's use of these performance metrics and their calculation are included in Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K submitted to the SEC on April 24, 2024, and in the Management Discussion section of the company's 2023 Annual Report, which is Exhibit 13 to the Form 10-K submitted with the SEC on February 26, 2024.

The stacked bars illustrate Segment Operating PTI, broken down by \"Hardware / Financing\", \"Services\", and \"Software\" segments. The line graph tracks Operating EPS. Historical EPS values include $3.32 around 2000 and $15.25 in 2011. Projected EPS values are \"At Least $16.25\" for 2013e/2014e and \"At Least $20\" for 2015e. The accompanying text also specifies a 2013 Operating EPS expectation of at least $16.25, or $16.90 excluding 2Q Workforce Rebalancing charge. The chart covers an extensive historical period from 2000 ('00) through 2012 ('12), and provides estimates up to 2015 ('15e), showing a general upward trend for Operating EPS. This chart provides a summary of IBM's operating profitability and per-share earnings trends, highlighting the company's long-term performance and future financial outlook, with the detailed segment breakdown offering insight into contributing business areas. The \"Non-GAAP\" footnote indicates specific adjustments for acquisition-related charges and non-operating retirement-related charges, crucial for understanding the reported figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis image displays the title and legend for a financial performance chart, focusing on \"Operating PTI / EPS\".

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. Effective January 1, 2011, the company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Unique Items (PLM Sale and/or Workforce Rebalancing)\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the company's PLM sale and/or workforce rebalancing. In March 2010, the company completed the sale of its activities associated with the sales and support of Dassault Systemes' (Dassault) product lifecycle management (PLM) software, including customer contracts and related assets to Dassault. In addition, the company has taken certain charges in connection with workforce rebalancing actions. Management believes that presenting certain financial information without one or both of these items is more representative of the company's operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors."

Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year's currency conversion rate. This consistent approach is based on the pricing currency for each country which is typically the functional currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/ losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Retail Store Solutions (RSS) Divestiture\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba Tec for the sale of its RSS business to Toshiba Tec. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the RSS divestiture. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors.\n\n## Workforce Rebalancing\n\nOn April 18, 2013, the company announced it expected to take most of its workforce rebalancing actions for 2013 in the second quarter as compared to 2012 when these actions were distributed across the four quarters of the year. The company took a $\\$ 1$ billion workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter. Management believes that presenting certain financial information without this item is most indicative of operational trajectory."

            "IBM financial presentation for the second quarter of the year 2013\n\n\n\nA waterfall chart illustrating the bridge of IBM's Operating Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Q2 2012 to Q2 2013. The chart begins with a 2Q12 Operating EPS of $3.51. Key factors influencing the change include a negative impact of ($0.12) from Revenue Growth, a positive contribution of $0.24 from Margin Expansion (excluding Workforce Rebalancing), a net negative impact of ($0.59) from Workforce Rebalancing (comprising a 2Q13 charge of ($0.69) and a 2Q12 charge of ($0.10)), and a positive impact of $0.18 from Share Repurchases. The chart shows an intermediate EPS of $3.91 before the final 2Q13 Workforce Rebalancing Charge, culminating in a 2Q13 Operating EPS of $3.22. This analysis highlights the significant drag on EPS from workforce rebalancing efforts, partially offset by margin expansion and share repurchases, leading to a slight decline in operating EPS year-over-year.

Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity.

Given the unique and/or non-recurring nature of these items, management believes that presenting certain financial information without these items is more representative of the company's operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nManagement excludes the impact of acquisitions from SG\\&A in certain markets to facilitate a more meaningful view of the company's operating performance. Acquisition-related expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the company's acquisitions.\n\n## Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nManagement excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the segments to facilitate a more meaningful view of the company's segment performance. Amortization related to acquired intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is impacted by the timing and magnitude of the company's acquisitions.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nManagement excludes stock-based compensation from the presentation of certain financial results for fiscal years 2000 and 2001. Stock-based compensation expense was not recorded at the segment level in fiscal years 2000 and 2001, therefore stock-based compensation expense has been excluded from the Segment PTI analysis."

For acquisitions, operating earnings excludes the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as inprocess research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related cost includes interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of operating earnings, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share road map, the company will utilize operating earnings to establish its objectives and track its progress."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-toperiod comparisons of the company's business performance. Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year's currency conversion rate. This consistent approach is based on the pricing currency for each country which is typically the functional currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## PLM Sale\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the PLM divestiture. In March 2010, the company completed the sale of its activities associated with the sales and support of Dassault Systemes' (Dassault) product lifecycle management (PLM) software, including customer contracts and related assets to Dassault. Given this sale, management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue and software segment revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Workforce Rebalancing\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of charges in connection with workforce rebalancing actions. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding pre-tax income, pre-tax income margin, and SG\\&A expense without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors.\n\n## Retail Store Solutions (RSS) Divestiture\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Toshiba Tec for the sale of its RSS business to Toshiba Tec. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the company completed the latest phase of the sale of its RSS business. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the RSS divestiture. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and/or earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year's currency conversion rate. This consistent approach is based on the pricing currency for each country which is typically the functional currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Other Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the following items: (1) certain income tax settlement payments, (2) the PLM divestiture (representing the March 2010 sale of IBM activities associated with the sales and support of Dassault Systemes' product lifecycle management (PLM) software, including customer contracts and related assets, to Dassault), (3) workforce rebalancing charges, and (4) Japan and Public Sector results. Management believes that presenting certain financial information without these items is more representative of the company's operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors."

The top chart, 'Pre-Tax Retirement-Related (Cost) / Income ($B)', shows a transition from pre-tax income of $0.5B in 2009, $0.4B in 2010, and $0.1B in 2011, to pre-tax costs of ($0.4B) in 2012, ($0.8B) in 2013, ($0.4B) in 2014, and approximately ($0.0B) in 2015. Concurrently, the bottom chart, 'Retirement-Related Cash Drivers ($B)', indicates consistent cash outflows, with actuals of ($1.7B) in 2009, ($1.5B) in 2010, and ($1.4B) in 2011, projected to remain at ($1.4B) for 2012-2014 before increasing slightly to ($1.5B) in 2015.

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. Effective January 1, 2011, the company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

            "\n\nThis financial slide presents IBM's Revenue by Geography for the fourth quarter of 2011, featuring a detailed table and a corroborating pie chart. Total IBM revenue reached $29.5 billion in 4Q11, reflecting a 2% year-over-year reported increase and a 1% increase at constant currency. The Americas segment contributed the largest share at $12.5 billion with 3% growth, while Asia Pacific and Japan experienced declines at constant currency of (1%) and (9%) respectively. Notably, Growth Markets demonstrated robust performance with an 8% year-over-year growth at constant currency, and BRIC Countries excelled with an 11% constant currency growth, offsetting the flat performance in Major Markets and a (9%) decline in OEM revenue.\n\n\n\n# Revenue by Geography\n\n|  $ in Billions | 4Q11 | B/(W) Yr/Yr Rptd | Yr/Yr @CC  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Americas | $12.5 | 3% | 3%  |\n|  Europe/ME/A | 9.6 | 1% | 1%  |\n|  Asia Pacific | 6.7 | 2% | (1%)  |\n|  OEM | 0.7 | (9%) | (9%)  |\n|  IBM | $29.5 | 2% | 1%  |\n|  Major Markets |  | Flat | Flat  |\n|  Growth Markets |  | 7% | 8%  |\n|  BRIC Countries |  | 10% | 11%  |\n\n\n\nThis slide title, 'Performance led by Growth Markets,' highlights a key strategic takeaway from IBM's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2011. It underscores that the robust revenue growth in Growth Markets, which achieved an 8% year-over-year increase at constant currency and 11% in BRIC countries, was a primary driver of the company's overall performance. This statement emphasizes the success of IBM's strategic focus on emerging economies and their significant contribution to the company's top-line expansion during the period.\n\n\n\n# Performance led by Growth Markets"

The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Customer Care Outsourcing and System x Business Divestiture\n\nWith respect to the sale of IBM's worldwide customer care outsourcing services business to SYNNEX, the initial closing date was January 31, 2014. With respect to the sale of IBM's x86 server business to Lenovo, the initial closing date was October 1, 2014. Management believes that presenting financial information without either or both of these items is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisitionrelated charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

Total revenue for the Infrastructure segment reached $3.4 billion, demonstrating a robust 23% year-over-year revenue growth, which includes approximately 9 percentage points attributed to sales to Kyndryl. The revenue categories breakdown further highlights strong performance in Hybrid Infrastructure with a 41% year-over-year increase, including approximately 11 percentage points from Kyndryl sales, while zSystems recorded exceptional growth of 98% and Distributed Infrastructure grew by 21%. Infrastructure Support experienced a modest 5% year-over-year growth, offset by a ~7 percentage point impact from Kyndryl sales. The zSystems performance was fueled by new workloads and demand in a hybrid cloud environment, and its mix benefit contributed to the pre-tax margin.\n\n"

            "# Non-GAAP Supplementary Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and/or earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior year's currency conversion rate. This consistent approach is based on the pricing currency for each country which is typically the functional currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## PLM Sale\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the PLM sale. In March 2010, the company completed the sale of its activities associated with the sales and support of Dassault Systemes' (Dassault) product lifecycle management (PLM) software, including customer contracts and related assets to Dassault. Given this sale, management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue and software segment revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful for investors."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Customer Care Outsourcing and System x Business Divestiture\n\nOn September 10, 2013, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with SYNNEX for the sale of IBM's worldwide customer care process outsourcing services business and on January 23, 2014, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with Lenovo for the sale of IBM's x86 server business. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the customer care process outsourcing services business and/or the x86 server business divestitures. Management believes that presenting financial information without either or both of these items is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisitionrelated charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Effective Tax Rate\n\nManagement presents the company's effective tax rate excluding the effects of a one-time tax benefit. Management believes this measure is more representative of the company's ongoing effective tax rate and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future effective tax rates, which may be more useful for investors."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. Effective January 1, 2011, the company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders."

From 2000 to 2008, the chart displays a significant upward trend in both EPS, reaching approximately $9.00 in 2008, and PTI Margin %, increasing to around 17% by 2008. The company is projecting EPS to be at least $9.70 in 2009 and targeting an objective of $10 to $11 in 2010. The data covers the period from fiscal year 2000 through an estimated 2009, with a stated objective for 2010, effectively showcasing a decade of financial evolution and future targets. The consistent upward trajectory of key profitability metrics from 2002 onwards reflects successful operational improvements. The 'Transformation' arrow and accompanying strategic initiatives, such as shifting portfolio to higher-value spaces, driving productivity, investing in skills, and returning capital to shareholders, underscore the drivers behind the strong financial performance.

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisitionrelated charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Customer Care Outsourcing and System x Business Divestiture\n\nWith respect to the sale of IBM's worldwide customer care outsourcing services business to SYNNEX, the initial closing date was January 31, 2014. With respect to the sale of IBM's x86 server business to Lenovo, the initial closing date was October 1, 2014. Management believes that presenting financial information without either or both of these items is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity.

The funded status for US plans slightly decreased from 102% to 101% while worldwide remained stable at 97% from 2014 to 2015. A significant financial impact is observed in the actual return on assets (ROA) which plummeted from 12.2% in 2014 to a negative 0.2% in 2015, despite a slight increase in the worldwide discount rate from 3.1% to 3.3%. This data provides critical insights into the financial health and underlying assumptions of IBM's pension obligations.\n\n\n\n## Retirement-Related Charges\n\n|   | Funded Status* | Expected ROA | Actual ROA | Discount Rate  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | US | WW | WW | WW  |\n|  YE 2014 | 102% | 97% | 6.7% | 12.2%  |\n|  YE 2015 | 101% | 97% | 6.4% | -0.2%  |\n\n## *Operating*\n\n## *Non-Operating*\n\n## *Pre-Tax Retirement-Related (Cost) / Income ($B)*\n\n\n\nMulti-panel bar chart illustrating IBM's pre-tax retirement-related costs/income and contribution drivers from 2011 to 2016, with 2016 being a projection.

The middle panel, representing operating retirement contribution drivers from tax-qualified plans, shows a decreasing trend in costs from ($1.9B) in 2011 to a projected ($1.4B) in 2016. The bottom panel details non-operating retirement contribution drivers, with costs fluctuating and projected at ($1.2B) for 2016.

The metrics are used to monitor the performance of the business and are viewed as useful decision-making information for management and stakeholders. The rationale for management's use of these performance metrics and their calculation, as well as other information including the definition of book of business, are included in Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K submitted to the SEC on July 24, 2024, or in the Management Discussion section of the company's 2023 Annual Report, which is Exhibit 13 to the Form 10-K submitted with the SEC on February 26, 2024.

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nCash Flow\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\nDebt-to-Capital Ratio\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multiemployer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Workforce Rebalancing\n\nManagement presents certain financial results excluding the effects of charges in connection with workforce rebalancing actions. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding pre-tax income, pre-tax income margin, and SG\\&A expense without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors.\n\n## Retail Store Solutions (RSS) divestiture\n\nIn the third quarter, the company completed the first two phases of the sale of its RSS business. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the RSS divestiture. Management believes that presenting financial information regarding revenue without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Customer Care Outsourcing and System x Business Divestiture\n\nWith respect to the sale of IBM's worldwide customer care outsourcing services business to SYNNEX, the initial closing date was January 31, 2014. With respect to the sale of IBM's x86 server business to Lenovo, the initial closing date was October 1, 2014. Management believes that presenting financial information without either or both of these items is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisitionrelated charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. Effective January 1, 2011, the company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement includes presentations of both cash flow from operations and free cash flow that exclude the effect of Global Financing Receivables. For a financing business, increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Receivables are viewed as an investment and an income-producing asset. Therefore, management presents financing receivables as an investing activity. Management's view is that this presentation gives the investor the best perspective of cash available for new investment or for distribution to shareholders.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations."

            "# Forward Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Information \n\nCertain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on the company's current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. Those statements by their nature address matters that are uncertain to different degrees. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from IBM Investor Relations. Any forward-looking statement made during this presentation speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law; these charts and the associated remarks and comments are integrally related, and are intended to be presented and understood together.\n\nIn an effort to provide additional and useful information regarding the company's financial results and other financial information as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, certain non-GAAP information including year to year change in revenue for Red Hat normalized for historical comparability, revenue adjusting for divested businesses and currency, operating earnings, other \"operating\" financial measures, including free cash flow, net cash from operating activities excluding Global Financing receivables, and adjustments for currency. The rationale for management's use of this non-GAAP information is included as Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 19, 2020. The reconciliation of non-GAAP information to GAAP is included on the slides entitled \"Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials\" in this presentation, as well as in Exhibit 99.1 to the company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 19, 2020.

Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Customer Care Outsourcing Business Divestiture\n\nOn September 10, 2013, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement with SYNNEX for the sale of its worldwide customer care process outsourcing services business. Management presents certain financial results excluding the effects of the customer care outsourcing business divestiture. Management believes that presenting financial information without this item is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors."

The rationale for management's use of this non-GAAP information is included as Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K submitted to the SEC on October 20, 2021. The reconciliation of non-GAAP information to GAAP is included on the slides entitled \"Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials\" in this presentation, as well as in Exhibit 99.1 to the company's Form 8-K submitted to the SECon October 20, 2021.

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\n## Cash Flow\n\nManagement uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company's operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company's ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profitgenerating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables.\n\n## Debt-to-Capital Ratio\n\nManagement presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1 . Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company's core business operations.\n\n## Workforce Rebalancing\n\nOn April 18, 2013, the company announced it expected to take most of its workforce rebalancing actions for 2013 in the second quarter as compared to 2012 when these actions were distributed across the four quarters of the year. The company took $\\$ 1$ billion workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter. Management believes that presenting certain financial information without this item is most indicative of operational trajectory."

            "# Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials \n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors.\n\n## Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items\n\nManagement presents certain financial measures excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs, and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term \"operating\" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirementrelated costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management's calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nOverall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company's pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For the 2015 earnings per share roadmap, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company's segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company's management and measurement system.\n\n## Constant Currency\n\nManagement refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates."

Forward-looking statements are based on the company's current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. Those statements by their nature address matters that are uncertain to different degrees. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM web site, or from IBM Investor Relations. Any forward-looking statement made during this presentation speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law; these charts and the associated remarks and comments are integrally related, and are intended to be presented and understood together.\n\nIn an effort to provide additional and useful information regarding the company's financial results and other financial information as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, certain non-GAAP information including revenue for Red Hat normalized for historical comparability, revenue adjusting for divested businesses and currency, operating earnings, other \"operating\" financial measures, including free cash flow, net cash from operating activities excluding Global Financing receivables, and adjustments for currency. The rationale for management's use of this non-GAAP information is included as Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 21, 2020. The reconciliation of non-GAAP information to GAAP is included on the slides entitled \"Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials\" in this presentation, as well as in Exhibit 99.1 to the company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 21, 2020.
