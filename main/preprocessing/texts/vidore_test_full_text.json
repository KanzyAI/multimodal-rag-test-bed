        "text": "In October 2016, we and KemPharm Inc. (\"KemPharm\") entered into a worldwide License Agreement (the \"KemPharm Agreement\") pursuant to which we licensed our Aversion ${ }^{\\circledR}$ Technology to KemPharm for its use in the development and commercialization of three products using 2 of KemPharm's prodrug candidates. KemPharm has also been granted an option to extend the KemPharm Agreement to cover two additional prodrug candidates. KemPharm is responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization activities.\n\nUpon execution of the KemPharm Agreement, KemPharm paid us an upfront payment of $\\$ 3.5$ million. If KemPharm exercises its option to use our Aversion Technology with more than the two licensed prodrugs, then KemPharm will pay us up to $\\$ 1.0$ million for each additional prodrug license. In addition, we will receive from KemPharm a low single digit royalty on commercial sales by KemPharm of products developed using our Aversion Technology under the KemPharm Agreement. KemPharm's royalty payment obligations commence on the first commercial sale of a product using our Aversion Technology and expire, on a country-by-country basis, upon the expiration of the last to expire patent claim of the Aversion Technology covering a product in such country, at which time the license for the particular product and country becomes fully paid and royalty free.\n\nThe KemPharm Agreement expires upon the expiration of KemPharm's royalty payment obligations in all countries. Either party may terminate the KemPharm Agreement in its entirety if the other party materially breaches the KemPharm Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods. Acura or KemPharm may terminate the KemPharm Agreement with respect to the U.S. and other countries if the other party challenges the patents covering the licensed products. KemPharm may terminate the KemPharm Agreement for convenience on ninety (90) days prior written notice. Termination does not affect a party's rights accrued prior thereto, but there are no stated payments in connection with termination other than payments of obligations previously accrued. For all terminations (but not expiration), the KemPharm Agreement provides for termination of our license grant to KemPharm.\n\n# NOTE 4 - REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS \n\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations under terms of a contract are satisfied, which occurs when control of the promised service is transferred to a customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring services to a customer (\"transaction price\"). The Company will then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When determining the transaction price of the contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance, resulting in a significant financing component. None of the Company's licenses and collaboration agreements contained a significant financing component at either December 31, 2019 or 2018.\n\nThe Company's existing license and collaboration agreements may contain a single performance obligation or may contain multiple performance obligations. Those which contain multiple performance obligations will require an allocation of the transaction price based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised services underlying each performance obligation.\n\nThe Company's existing license and collaboration agreements contain customer options for the license of additional products and territories. We determined the option's standalone selling prices based on the option product's potential market size in the option territory as compared to the currently licensed product and U.S. territory. Some of our existing license and collaboration agreements contain a license to the technology as well as licenses to tradenames or trademarks. The Company determined that the licenses to the tradenames or trademarks were immaterial in context of the contract.\n\n## Sales-based Milestones and Royalty Revenues\n\nThe commercial sales-based milestones and sales royalties earned under the license and collaboration for Oxaydo and sales royalties earned under the license for the Nexafed products, are recorded in the period of the related sales by Zyla and MainPointe. Payments of sales-based milestones are generally due within 30 days after the end of a calendar year. Payments of royalties are generally due within 45 days after the end of a calendar quarter."

Cost for self-constructed towers includes direct materials and labor, capitalized interest and certain indirect costs associated with construction of the tower, such as transportation costs, employee benefits and payroll taxes. The Company begins the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period, which is the period during which costs are incurred to evaluate the site, and continues to capitalize costs until the tower is substantially completed and ready for occupancy by a tenant. Labor and related costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $\\$ 48.3$ million, $\\$ 55.0$ million and $\\$ 50.9$ million, respectively. Capitalized interest costs were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset's useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. Towers and related assets on leased land are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the corresponding ground lease, taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value.\n\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not exceeding twenty years.\n\nThe Company reviews its tower portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues.

        "text": "## Exchange Rates\n\nThe sales prices for our ordinary shares traded on German stock exchanges are denominated in euro. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar affect the dollar equivalent of the euro price of the ordinary shares traded on the German stock exchanges and, as a result, may affect the price of the ADRs traded on the NYSE in the United States. See \"Item 9. The Offer and Listing\" for a description of the ADRs. In addition, SAP SE pays cash dividends, if any, in euro. As a result, any exchange rate fluctuations will also affect the dollar amounts received by the holders of ADRs on the conversion into dollars of cash dividends paid in euro on the ordinary shares represented by the ADRs. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is the depositary (the Depositary) for SAP SE's ADR program. The deposit agreement with respect to the ADRs requires the Depositary to convert any dividend payments from euro into dollars as promptly as practicable upon receipt. For additional information on the Depositary and the fees associated with SAP's ADR program see \"Item 12. Description of Securities Other Than Equity Securities - American Depositary Shares.\"\n\nFor details on the impact of exchange rate fluctuations see \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Exposure\".\n\n## Dividends\n\n## Dividend Distribution Policy\n\nDividends are jointly proposed by SAP SE's Supervisory Board (Aufsichtsrat) and Executive Board (Vorstand) based on SAP SE's year-end stand-alone statutory financial statements, subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. Dividends are officially declared for the prior year at SAP SE's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. SAP SE's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders usually convenes during the second quarter of each year. Beginning with the dividends payable for the 2017 fiscal year and in accordance with a change of the German Stock Corporation Act that aims to implement joint market standards in Europe for corporate actions processing, dividends are remitted to the custodian bank on behalf of the shareholders on the third business day following the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. Record holders of the ADRs on the dividend record date will be entitled to receive payment of the dividend declared in respect of the year for which it is declared. Cash dividends payable to such holders will be paid to the Depositary in euro and, subject to certain exceptions, will be converted by the Depositary into U.S. dollars.\n\nDividends paid to holders of the ADRs may be subject to German withholding tax. See \"Item 8. Financial Information Other Financial Information - Dividend Policy\" and \"Item 10. Additional Information - Taxation,\" for further information.\n\n## Annual Dividends Paid and Proposed\n\nThe following table sets forth in euro the annual dividends paid or proposed to be paid per ordinary share in respect of each of the years indicated. One SAP ADR currently represents one SAP SE ordinary share. Accordingly, the final dividend per ADR is equal to the dividend for one SAP SE ordinary share and is dependent on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. The table does not reflect tax credits that may be available to German taxpayers who\nreceive dividend payments. If you own our ordinary shares or ADRs and if you are a U.S. resident, refer to \"Item 10. Additional Information - Taxation,\" for further information.\n\n|  | Dividend Paid per Ordinary Share |  |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| Year Ended December 31, | \u20ac | US\\$ |\n| 2015 | 1.15 | $1.30^{(1)}$ |\n| 2016 | 1.25 | $1.37^{(1)}$ |\n| 2017 | 1.40 | $1.65^{(1)}$ |\n| 2018 | 1.50 | $1.68^{(1)}$ |\n| 2019 (proposed) | $1.58^{(2)}$ | $1.73^{(2),(3)}$ |\n\n${ }^{(1)}$ Translated for the convenience of the reader from euro into U.S. dollars at the Noon Buying Rate for converting euro into U.S. dollars on the dividend payment date. The Depositary is required to convert any dividend payments received from SAP as promptly as practicable upon receipt.\n${ }^{(2)}$ Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of SAP SE currently scheduled to be held on May 15, 2020.\n${ }^{(3)}$ Translated for the convenience of the reader from euro into U.S. dollars at the Noon Buying Rate for converting euro into U.S. dollars on February 7, 2020 of US\\$1,0950 per \u20ac 1.00. The dividend paid may differ due to changes in the exchange rate.\n\nThe amount of dividends paid on the ordinary shares depends on the amount of profits to be distributed by SAP SE, which depends in part upon our financial performance. In addition, the amount of dividends received by holders of ADRs may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates (see \"Item 3. Key Information Exchange Rates\"). The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividend will depend upon our future earnings, capital needs and other relevant factors, in each case as proposed by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of SAP SE and approved by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nIn light of SAP's strong financial performance and healthy balance sheet, the Supervisory Board of SAP SE approved, on November 4, 2019, the Executive Board's plan for enhanced capital return in 2020. Under this new program, the Company intends to repurchase shares and/or issue a special dividend with a combined volume of $\u20ac 1.5$ billion by December 31, 2020."

As of June 30, 2019, tax years 2004-2019 remain subject to examination in the jurisdictions where the Company operates.\n\nThe Company is in various stages of examinations in connection with all of its tax audits worldwide, and it is difficult to determine when these examinations will be settled. It is reasonably possible that over the next 12-month period the Company may experience an increase or decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax examinations or lapses of statute of limitations. The change in unrecognized tax benefits may range up to $\\$ 12$ million.\n\n# Note 8: Net Income per Share\n\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the treasury stock method, for dilutive stock options, restricted stock units, and convertible notes."

Due to these factors, management believes that no additional credit risk beyond amounts provided for collection losses is inherent in the Company's trade receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2019, two customers accounted for $17.1 \\%$ and $14.4 \\%$, respectively, of the Company's revenue from continuing operations and are the same customers who accounted for $13.1 \\%$ and $11.6 \\%$, respectively, of the Company's revenue from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2018, the 380,952 shares remained in escrow. In July 2019, we reached an agreement to settle the $\\$ 0.6$ million working capital adjustment receivable and other claims with the sellers of Golden Ridge. As a result, (i) 340,000 shares of common stock held in the escrow account ( $\\$ 1.0$ million fair value as of both the settlement date and the November 28, 2018, acquisition date) were returned to us and retired, (ii) the remaining $\\$ 0.4$ million note payable we owed to a seller was cancelled and (iii) certain open grain purchase contracts with entities related to a seller were terminated. We recorded a gain on the noncash settlement of $\\$ 0.8$ million in the third quarter of 2019 , which is included in other income. In connection with the foregoing, a settlement agreement was entered into among the parties. All shares of common stock were distributed and the escrow agreement was terminated.\n\nThe fair value of trade receivables for Golden Ridge at acquisition was $\\$ 1.6$ million, which was $\\$ 0.1$ million less than the value of gross trade receivables. Goodwill was primarily attributed to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and synergies generated by Golden Ridge's integration with our other operations. Between December 31, 2018, and June 30, 2019, information was discovered requiring adjustments to the opening balance sheet of Golden Ridge. The adjustments resulted primarily from an overstatement of the opening balances of commodities payable and accounts payable at December 31, 2018. These balances were adjusted in the June 30, 2019, financial statements. The impact of the adjustments to our prior period financial statements is not considered significant.

Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure.\n\n# SEGMENT RESULTS \n\n## Cubic Transportation Systems\n\n|  | Fiscal 2019 | Fiscal 2018 | \\% Change |\n| :-- | --: | --: | --: |\n|  | (in millions) |  |  |\n| Sales | $\\$ 849.8$ | $\\$ 670.7$ | $27 \\%$ |\n| Operating income | 77.2 | 60.4 | 28 |\n| Adjusted EBITDA | 110.5 | 73.3 | 51 |\n\nSales: CTS sales increased 27\\% to $\\$ 849.8$ million in 2019 compared to $\\$ 670.7$ million in 2018, including the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. The increase in sales was primarily driven by growth in both organic and inorganic business in North America. Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $\\$ 74.4$ million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $\\$ 22.2$ million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar.\n\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles: Amortization of purchased intangibles included in the CTS operating results totaled $\\$ 22.0$ million in 2019 and $\\$ 5.2$ million in 2018. The increase is due to the amortization of purchased intangibles for companies acquired by CTS in fiscal year 2019.\n\nOperating Income: CTS operating income increased 28\\% in 2019 to $\\$ 77.2$ million compared to $\\$ 60.4$ million in 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily caused by higher margins on increased work on development projects in New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area and Brisbane, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. These increases in operating income were partially offset by operating losses incurred by businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal 2019 as well as the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal years 2019 incurred operating losses of $\\$ 10.1$ million in fiscal 2019, which included acquisition transaction costs of $\\$ 8.1$ million and amortization of intangible assets totaling $\\$ 19.3$ million. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS operating income of $\\$ 3.6$ million for 2019 compared to 2018.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA: CTS Adjusted EBITDA increased 51\\% to $\\$ 110.5$ million in 2019 compared to $\\$ 73.3$ million in 2018. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the same factors that drove the increase in operating income described above excluding the increases in amortization of purchased intangibles and acquisition transaction costs which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for CTS increased by $\\$ 2.3$ million in 2019 as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard."

Future dividend payments, if any, are at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Changes in our dividend program will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, debt covenant compliance, expected cash needs and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.\n\n# Share-based Compensation\n\nOur Board of Directors may grant share-based awards from our shareholder approved Amended and Restated Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \"Plan\"). The Plan permits the issuance of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock grants, stock unit grants and other equity-based awards to eligible directors and employees at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. On April 30, 2018, the shareholders approved an amendment to the Plan to increase by 2,000,000 the number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance under the Plan and extend the term of the Plan through April 30, 2028. With the amendment, approximately $4,650,000$ shares of our common stock are authorized for issuance under the Plan, provided that no more than 300,000 shares may be granted in the form of stock options or stock appreciation rights to any eligible employee or director in any calendar year. Unless terminated sooner, the Plan will continue in effect until April 30, 2028.\n\nWe measure the fair value of RSAs based on the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. We recognize the expense associated with RSAs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which generally ranges from immediate vesting to a four year vesting period.\n\nWe implemented an ongoing performance-based incentive program under the Plan. The performance-based incentive program provides for annual grants of PSAs. PSAs are restricted stock that are issued, to the extent earned, at the end of each performance cycle. Under the performance-based incentive program, each participant is given a target award expressed as a number of shares, with a payout opportunity ranging from $0 \\%$ to $120 \\%$ of the target, depending on performance relative to predetermined goals. An estimate of the number of PSAs that are expected to vest is made, and the fair value of the PSAs is expensed utilizing the fair value on the date of grant over the requisite service period.\n\nThe following table summarizes grants of RSAs and PSAs under the Plan during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\n|   | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |  |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | 2019 | Grant Date Fair Value | 2018 | Grant Date Fair Value | 2017 | Grant Date Fair Value  |\n|  RSAs Granted | 551,214 | \\$ 9.87 | 478,210 | \\$ 12.45 | 124,100 | \\$ 23.12  |\n|  PSAs Granted | 371,672 | \\$ 12.45 | - | \\$ | 36,982 | \\$ 23.27  |\n|  Total | 922,886 |  | 478,210 |  | 161,082 |   |\n\nThe following table summarizes the RSA and PSA activity during the year ended December 31, 2019:\n\n|   | RSAs |  |  | PSAs |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Shares |  | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value | Shares |  | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value  |\n|  Non-vested shares outstanding - December 31, 2018 |  | 338,771 | \\$ | 14.31 | 35,626 | \\$ 21.97  |\n|  Shares granted |  | 551,214 | \\$ | 9.87 | 371,672 | \\$ 12.45  |\n|  Shares vested |  | $(318,891)$ | \\$ | 12.14 | $(116,323)$ | \\$ 14.57  |\n|  Shares forfeited, cancelled or retired |  | $(38,649)$ | \\$ | 10.77 | $(14,980)$ | \\$ 12.74  |\n|  Non-vested shares outstanding - December 31, 2019 |  | 532,445 | \\$ | 11.58 | 275,995 | \\$ 13.29  |\n\nThe total fair value of the RSAs and PSAs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $\\$ 5.6$ million, $\\$ 4.1$ million and $\\$ 3.4$ million, respectively."

To a lesser degree, an increase in legacy Ceramic products' net sales of $\\$ 6.0$ million in the EMS channel across all regions and $\\$ 10.2$ million in the OEM channel in the EMEA and APAC regions also contributed to the increase in Solid Capacitors net sales. These increases were partially offset by a $\\$ 28.0$ million decrease in net sales in the OEM channel for legacy Tantalum products across all regions. In addition, Solid Capacitors net sales was favorably impacted by $\\$ 6.1$ million from foreign currency exchange due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\n\n## Reportable Segment Operating Income\n\nSegment operating income of $\\$ 234.5$ million for fiscal year 2018 increased $\\$ 86.8$ million or $58.8 \\%$ from $\\$ 147.7$ million for fiscal year 2017.

Legacy KEMET gross margin increased $\\$ 53.3$ million, or $30.6 \\%$, primarily driven by an increase in net sales, cost improvements in vertical integration, favorable foreign currency impact to manufacturing costs, and manufacturing process improvements resulting from our cost reduction activities. In addition, there was a $\\$ 1.6$ million improvement in (gain) loss on write down and disposal of long-lived assets. Partially offsetting these improvements were a $\\$ 10.5$ million increase in SG\\&A expenses and a $\\$ 5.0$ million increase in R\\&D expenses.

These take the form of defined benefit plans directly from the employer (employer's commitments) and defined benefit plans from external pension providers (benevolent funds in Germany and international pension funds). The external providers' assets serve exclusively to finance the pension entitlements and qualify as plan assets. The benefits under the different plans are based on performance and length of service.\n\nThe most important performance-based pension plans are described in the following.\n\n## Germany\n\nMETRO grants many employees in Germany retirement, disability and surviving dependant's benefits. New commitments are granted in the form of 'defined benefit' commitments in the meaning of IAS 19 (contribution-oriented commitments pursuant to German company pension law), which comprise a payment contribution component and an employer-matching component. Contributions are paid to a pension reinsurance from which benefits are paid out when the insured event occurs. A provision is recognised for entitlements not covered by pension reinsurance.\n\nIn addition, various pension funds exist that are closed for new contributions. In general, these provide for lifelong pensions starting with the start of retirement or recognised invalidity. Benefits are largely defined as fixed payments or on the basis of set annual increases. In special cases, benefits are calculated in consideration of accrued statutory pension entitlements. The commitments provide for a widow's or widower's pension of varying size, depending on the benefits the former employee received or would have received in case of invalidity. Legacy commitments are partially covered by assets held in benevolent funds. Provisions are recognised for those commitments not covered. The benevolent funds' decision-making bodies (management board and general assembly of members) comprise both employer and employee representatives. The respective members of the Management Board decide on the deployment of funds and financial investments. It may commission third parties to manage fund assets. No statutory minimum endowment"

The decrease was primarily due to the reclassification of $\\$ 3.15$ billion total carrying value of our $\\$ 2.25$ billion term loan due April 30, 2020 (\"Term Loan\") and $\\$ 900$ million $4.75 \\%$ senior notes due February 1, 2020 (\"2020 Notes\") to current liabilities. We intend to refinance our Term Loan and 2020 Notes on or before the due dates.\n\nA summary of our cash flows is as follows:\n\n| (in millions) | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities | \\$ 4,421.8 | \\$ 4,029.3 | \\$ 2,912.9 |\n| Net cash used for investing activities | (455.6) | $(4,685.3)$ | (442.9) |\n| Net cash used for financing activities | $(2,946.1)$ | $(5.6)$ | $(1,183.7)$ |\n| Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents | (12.7) | (1.7) | 8.5 |\n| Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents | \\$ 1,007.4 | \\$ $(663.3)$ | \\$ 1,294.8 |\n\nOur primary source of cash is receipts from revenue and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. The primary uses of cash are our stock repurchase program as described below, payroll-related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other uses of cash include business acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.\n\n## Cash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nFor fiscal 2019, net cash provided by operating activities of $\\$ 4.42$ billion was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with an increase in deferred revenue, which was offset in large part by cash outflows due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily driven by increases related to Digital Media offerings with cloud-enabled services and Digital Experience hosted services. The primary working capital use of cash was due to increases in prepaid expenses with certain vendors, sales commissions paid and capitalized, advanced payments related to income taxes and increase in long-term contract assets.\n\n## Cash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nFor fiscal 2019, net cash used for investing activities of $\\$ 455.6$ million was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment and our acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Allegorithmic. These cash outflows were offset primarily by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions.\n\n## Cash Flows from Financing Activities\n\nFor fiscal 2019, net cash used for financing activities was $\\$ 2.95$ billion primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, which were offset by proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock for our employee stock purchase plan. See the section titled \"Stock Repurchase Program\" discussed below.\n\nWe expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business."

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers projected future taxable income, carryback opportunities, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowances recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company decreased its valuation allowance by $12.8 million which relates to a reduction in the valuation allowance on U.S. foreign tax credits offset by an increase in valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses.At December 31, 2019, the Company had domestic federal tax net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of $65.9 million, which will begin to expire in 2020. The Company had deferred tax assets equal to $1.4 million related to domestic state tax NOLs which will begin to expire in 2020. The Company does not have any valuation allowance against the federal tax NOLs but has provided a $1.2 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with the state NOLs. The Company had foreign tax NOLs of $30.4 million, of which $28.1 million may be utilized over an indefinite life, with the remainder expiring over the next 17 years. The Company has provided a $0.7 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with the foreign NOLs.The Company had U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2019, of $40.7 million, for which an $1.2 million valuation allowance has been provided. The U.S. foreign tax credits will begin to expire in 2022. The Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards in other foreign jurisdictions at December 31, 2019, of $1.9 million, of which $1.3 million may be utilized over an indefinite life, with the remainder expiring over the next seven years. The Company has provided a $1.2 million valuation allowance against the tax benefit associated with these foreign credits. The Company also has domestic federal and state general business tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2019, of $15.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2020 and 2022, respectively.The unrecognized tax benefit at December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $29.0 million and $28.4 million, respectively, of which $22.4 million and $22.6 million, respectively, are included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

We may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans. |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  *Interest Expense:* |  |  |  |  |   |\n|   | Year Ended May 31, |  |  |  |   |\n|   | 2019 |  | Percent Change |  | 2018  |\n|  (Dollars in millions) |  |  | Actual | Constant |   |\n|  Interest expense | $2,082 |  | 3% | 3% | $2,025  |\n|  Interest expense increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $10.0 billion of senior notes in November 2017, which was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting primarily from the maturities and repayments of $2.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2019 and $6.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2018. |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  *Non-Operating Income, net:* Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan) and net other income, including net recognized gains and losses related to all of our investments, net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan, net unrealized gains and losses related to certain equity securities and non-service net periodic pension income (losses). |  |  |  |  |   |\n|   | Year Ended May 31, |  |  |  |   |\n|   | 2019 |  | Percent Change |  | 2018  |\n|  (Dollars in millions) |  |  | Actual | Constant |   |\n|  Interest income | $1,092 |  | -9% | -9% | $1,203  |\n|  Foreign currency losses, net | (111) |  | 50% | 62% | (74)  |\n|  Noncontrolling interests in income | (152) |  | 12% | 12% | (135)  |\n|  Other income, net | (14) |  | -107% | -42% | 191  |\n|  Total non-operating income, net | $815 |  | -31% | -31% | $1,185  |"

The Company adopted the standard on a retrospective basis which results in reclassifications for the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost from selling, general and administrative expense to cost of revenue and for the other components from selling, general and administrative expense to other expense. Prior periods have not been reclassified due to immateriality.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nWeighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation for the plans for the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\n\n|  | Pension |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |\n| Net periodic benefit cost: |  |  |  |\n| Expected long-term return on plan assets ${ }^{(1)}$ | 3.6\\% | 3.8\\% | $3.3 \\%$ |\n| Rate of compensation increase | $4.4 \\%$ | $3.3 \\%$ | $2.7 \\%$ |\n| Discount rate | $2.2 \\%$ | $2.1 \\%$ | $1.9 \\%$ |\n| Projected benefit obligation: |  |  |  |\n| Expected long-term return on plan assets | 2.0\\% | $3.6 \\%$ | $4.0 \\%$ |\n| Rate of compensation increase | $4.3 \\%$ | $4.4 \\%$ | $4.4 \\%$ |\n| Discount rate ${ }^{(2)}$ | $1.7 \\%$ | $2.2 \\%$ | $2.3 \\%$ |\n\n(1) The expected return on plan assets assumption used in calculating net periodic benefit cost is based on historical return experience and estimates of future long-term performance with consideration to the expected investment mix of the plan.\n(2) The discount rate is used to state expected cash flows relating to future benefits at a present value on the measurement date. This rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments whose timing would match the cash outflow of retirement benefits. Other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover.\n\n## Plan Assets\n\nThe Company has adopted an investment policy for a majority of plan assets, which was set by plan trustees who have the responsibility for making investment decisions related to the plan assets. The plan trustees oversee the investment allocation, including selecting professional investment managers and setting strategic targets. The investment objectives for the assets are (1) to acquire suitable assets that hold the appropriate liquidity in order to"

BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nThe Company's primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. This business is referred to as the Company's property operations.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, as a result of recent acquisitions, including the Eaton Towers Acquisition, and changes to its organizational structure, the Company reviewed and changed its reportable segments to divide its EMEA property segment into two segments: Africa property and Europe property. Prior to this revision, the Company operated in five business segments: (i) U.S. property, (ii) Asia property (iii) EMEA property, (iv) Latin America property and (v) services. The change is consistent with how the chief operating decision maker reviews financial performance and operating and business management strategies for each of the six segments. The change in reportable segments had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company's property operations consisted of the following:\n\n- U.S.: property operations in the United States;\n- Asia: property operations in India;\n- Africa: property operations in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda;\n- Europe: property operations in France and Germany; and\n- Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru.\n\nThe Company's services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP and structural analysis, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\n\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. For reporting purposes, for periods through September 30, 2018, the Latin America property segment gross margin and segment operating profit also included Interest income (expense), TV"

The gross profit margin on used sales was 52.2 percent and 54.2 percent for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the gross profit margin was driven by lower margins on internal used equipment sales.\n\nGlobal Financing pre-tax income decreased 22.5 percent year to year primarily driven by a decrease in gross profit ( $\\$ 422$ million), partially offset by a decrease in total expense ( $\\$ 115$ million), which was mainly driven by a decline in IBM shared expenses in line with the segment's performance, a lower provision for credit losses and a gain from the sale of certain commercial financing capabilities in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nThe decrease in return on equity from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to lower net income.

Such inputs are categorised into three levels within a fair value hierarchy as follows:\n\n- Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);\n- Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2); and\n- Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).\n\n|  | Level 1 <br> RMB'Million | Level 2 <br> RMB'Million | Level 3 <br> RMB'Million | Total <br> RMB'Million |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | --: |\n| As at 31 December 2019 |  |  |  |  |\n| FVPL | $\\mathbf{1 4 , 7 6 6}$ | $\\mathbf{5 , 0 9 1}$ | $\\mathbf{1 1 6 , 0 7 9}$ | $\\mathbf{1 3 5 , 9 3 6}$ |\n| FVOCI | $\\mathbf{7 4 , 7 0 7}$ | - | $\\mathbf{7 , 0 1 4}$ | $\\mathbf{8 1 , 7 2 1}$ |\n| OFA | - | $\\mathbf{3 7 5}$ | - | $\\mathbf{3 7 5}$ |\n| Other financial liabilities | - | $\\mathbf{5 2 3}$ | $\\mathbf{1 , 8 7 3}$ | $\\mathbf{2 , 3 9 6}$ |\n| As at 31 December 2018 |  |  |  |  |\n| FVPL | 10,875 | 5,009 | 81,993 | 97,877 |\n| FVOCI | 41,578 | - | 1,941 | 43,519 |\n| OFA | - | 2,032 | - | 2,032 |\n| Other financial liabilities | - | 40 | 4,466 | 4,506 |\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is determined with reference to quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. These instruments are included in level 1.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required for evaluating the fair value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2."

The net (decrease) increase to the valuation allowance of $\\$(0.1)$ million, $\\$(1.5)$ million, and $\\$ 6.8$ million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, was primarily due to additional net operating losses generated by the Company.\n\nDeferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries because the Company's practice and intent is to permanently reinvest these earnings. The cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings was $\\$ 5.3$ million and $\\$ 3.1$ million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Any future distribution of these non-US earnings may subject the Company to state income taxes, as adjusted for tax credits, and foreign withholding taxes that the Company estimates would be $\\$ 0.1$ million and $\\$ 0.1$ million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\n\n|   | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | 2019 | 2018 |  | 2017  |\n|  Balance at January 1 | \\$ | 1,402 | \\$ | 1,271  |\n|  Increases for tax positions related to the current year |  | \u2014 | 131 | 995  |\n|  Decreases for tax positions related to the current year |  | $(1,402)$ | \u2014 | \u2014  |\n|  Balance at December 31 | \\$ | \u2014 | \\$ | 1,402  |\n\nThe provision for uncertain tax positions relates to business in territories outside of the US. The Company's policy is to classify interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of tax expense. The Company does not expect the change in uncertain tax positions to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\n\nThe Company is subject to US federal income tax as well as to income tax in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions, including the UK. Federal income tax returns of the Company are subject to IRS examination for the 2016 through 2019 tax years. State income tax returns are subject to examination for the 2015 through 2019 tax years.\n\nCurrently, an audit is occurring in the United Kingdom for the year ended December 31, 2017. There are no ongoing audits in any other significant foreign tax jurisdictions."

The telecommunications business requires extensive and continual investments, including investment in new technologies and the expansion of capacity and geographical reach. Expenditures related to the acquisition of spectrum licences and additions to right-of-use assets are not included in capital expenditures and do not factor into the calculation of free cash flow or capital intensity. See \"Managing Our Liquidity and Financial Resources\", \"Key Performance Indicators\", and \"Non-GAAP Measures and Related Performance Measures\" for more information.\n\nCapital expenditures are significant and have a material impact on our cash flows; therefore, our management teams focus on planning, funding, and managing them. We believe this measure best reflects our cost of property, plant and equipment in a given period and is a simpler measure for comparing between periods.\n\n|  (In millions of dollars, except capital | Years ended December 31 |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  intensity) | 2019 | 2018 | \\% Chg  |\n|  Capital expenditures ${ }^{1}$ |  |  |   |\n|  Wireless | 1,320 | 1,086 | 22  |\n|  Cable | 1,153 | 1,429 | $(19)$  |\n|  Media | 102 | 90 | 13  |\n|  Corporate | 232 | 185 | 25  |\n|  Capital expenditures ${ }^{1}$ | 2,807 | 2,790 | 1  |\n|  Capital intensity ${ }^{2}$ | $18.6 \\%$ | $18.5 \\%$ | 0.1 pts  |\n\n${ }^{1}$ Includes additions to property, plant and equipment net of proceeds on disposition, but does not include expenditures for spectrum licences or additions to right-of-use assets. ${ }^{2}$ As defined. See \"Key Performance Indicators\".\n\n## WIRELESS\n\nThe increase in capital expenditures in Wireless this year was a result of investments made to upgrade our wireless network to continue delivering reliable performance for our customers. We continued augmenting our existing LTE network with 4.5G technology investments that are also 5G-ready to prepare for the commercial launch of 5G in select markets in early 2020. In 2019, we acquired spectrum licences for \\$1,731 million, which is not included in the table above. See \"Managing Our Liquidity and Financial Resources\".\n\n## CABLE\n\nThe decrease in capital expenditures in Cable this year was a result of lower purchases of customer premise equipment and lower investments related to the initial launch of Ignite TV. We have continued upgrading our network infrastructure with additional fibre deployments, including increasing our fibre-to-the-home and fibre-to-the-curb distribution. These upgrades will lower the number of homes passed per node and incorporate the latest technologies to help deliver more bandwidth and an even more reliable customer experience as we progress in our Connected Home roadmap.\n\n## MEDIA\n\nThe increase in capital expenditures this year was a result of higher investments in renovations at various Toronto Blue Jays facilities, partially offset by lower investment in our broadcast and IT infrastructure and the sale of our publishing business.\n\n## CORPORATE\n\nThe increase in Corporate capital expenditures this year was a result of higher investments in IT and our various real estate facilities this year, including the impact of $\\$ 25$ million of proceeds from the sale of certain assets last year.\n\n## CAPITAL INTENSITY\n\nCapital intensity this year was in line with 2018."

Included in the weighted average shares outstanding is the share consideration in connection with the Restaurant Magic Acquisition (See Note 2 Acquisitions) in the amount of 908,192 for the period after the close of the transaction. The shares were issued in January 2020, however, no contingencies existed as of the date of the acquisition."

        "text": "# MAXLINEAR, INC. <br> NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentage data) \n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04,Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. An entity no longer will determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Instead, under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The Board also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. The amendments in this update are effective for the Company beginning with fiscal year 2020, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The adoption of the amendments in this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13,Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework- Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, to improve the fair value measurement reporting of financial instruments. The amendments in this update require, among other things, added disclosure of the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments in this update eliminate, among other things, disclosure of the reasons for and amounts of transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and an entity's valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. The amendments in this update will be effective for the Company beginning with fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. Retrospective application is required for all amendments in this update except the added disclosures, which should be applied prospectively. The adoption of the amendments in this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15,Intangibles- Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract, to provide additional guidance on the accounting for costs of implementing cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts. The amendments in this update require the capitalization of implementation costs during the application development stage of such hosting arrangements and amortization of the expense over the term of the arrangement including any option to extend reasonably certain to be exercised or option to terminate reasonably certain not to be exercised. Capitalized implementation costs and amortization thereof are also required to be classified in the same line item in the statements of financial position, operations and cash flows associated with the hosting service fees. The amendments in this update will be effective for the Company beginning with fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. Entities may select retrospective or prospective application to all implementation costs incurred after the adoption date. The adoption of the amendments in this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.\n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12Income Taxes (Topic 740)-Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, to remove certain exceptions and improve consistency of application, including, among other things, requiring that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The amendments in this update will be effective for the Company beginning with fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted. Most amendments within the standard are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The adoption of the amendments in this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.\n\n## 2. Net Income (Loss) Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share, or EPS, is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and the weighted-average number of dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. For purposes of this calculation, common stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted EPS when their effect is dilutive. In periods in which the Company has a net loss, dilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS."

        "text": "There were no repurchases of common stock during fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017. As of March 31, 2019, we held approximately 15.6 million shares as treasury shares.\n\nOn October 28, 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. The initial quarterly dividend of $\\$ 0.02$ per share was paid on December 6, 2003 in the amount of $\\$ 4.1$ million. To date, our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately $\\$ 3.8$ billion. Cash dividends paid per share were $\\$ 1.457, \\$ 1.449$ and $\\$ 1.441$ during fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Total dividend payments amounted to $\\$ 344.4$ million, $\\$ 337.5$ million, $\\$ 315.4$ million during fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. A quarterly cash dividend of $\\$ 0.3655$ per share was declared on May 7, 2019 and will be paid on June 4, 2019, to stockholders of record as of May 21, 2019. We expect the aggregate cash dividend for June 4, 2019 to be approximately $\\$ 87.0$ million. Our Board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend, on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. Our current intent is to provide for ongoing quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions, our results of operations and potential changes in tax laws.\n\nWe believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, the semiconductor industry is capital intensive. In order to remain competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development. We may increase our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes. The timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including our level of dividend payments, changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash (including the impact of the Act), demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders.\n\n# Contractual Obligations \n\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at March 31, 2019, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions):\n\n|  | Payments Due by Period |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | Total | Less than 1 year | $1-3$ years | $3-5$ years | More than 5 years |\n| Operating lease obligations ${ }^{(1)}$ | \\$ 167.1 | \\$ 49.0 | \\$ 68.4 | \\$ 27.1 | \\$ 22.6 |\n| Capital purchase obligations ${ }^{(2)}$ | 18.8 | 18.8 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| Other purchase obligations and commitments ${ }^{(3)}$ | 205.6 | 194.9 | 10.5 | 0.2 | \u2014 |\n| Term Loan Facility ${ }^{(4)}$ | 2,435.4 | 72.5 | 174.7 | 174.4 | 2,013.8 |\n| Revolving Credit Facility ${ }^{(5)}$ | 3,879.0 | 147.0 | 294.0 | 3,438.0 | \u2014 |\n| 2023 and 2021 Senior Notes | 2,293.0 | 82.5 | 1,145.5 | 1,065.0 | \u2014 |\n| 2017 Senior Convertible Debt ${ }^{(6)}$ | 2,339.1 | 33.6 | 67.3 | 67.3 | 2,170.9 |\n| 2015 Senior Convertible Debt ${ }^{(7)}$ | 1,893.2 | 28.0 | 56.1 | 56.1 | 1,753.0 |\n| 2017 Junior Convertible Debt ${ }^{(8)}$ | 964.0 | 15.4 | 30.9 | 30.9 | 886.8 |\n| Pension obligations ${ }^{(9)}$ | 20.7 | 1.3 | 3.4 | 4.1 | 11.9 |\n| Transition tax obligation ${ }^{(10)}$ | 245.7 | 9.9 | 44.9 | 64.6 | 126.3 |\n| Total contractual obligations ${ }^{(11)}$ | \\$ 14,461.6 | \\$ 652.9 | \\$ 1,895.7 | \\$ 4,927.7 | \\$ 6,985.3 |\n\n${ }^{(1)}$ Operating lease obligations include $\\$ 18.1$ million of future lease payments which is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet as of March 31, 2019.

A non-employee director receives a combination of options and/or restricted stock unit awards on the date of each annual meeting of our stockholders, as follows:\n\n- The number of shares of common stock in the restricted stock unit award is determined by dividing (1) a dollar value to be paid in the form of restricted stock units (\"Restricted Stock Unit Amount\") by (2) the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant.\n- The number of shares that may be purchased pursuant to the option award is determined by dividing (1) a dollar amount to be paid in the form of option grants (\"Option Amount\") by (2) the quotient of (A) the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant divided by (B) two (2).\n- The total of the Restricted Stock Unit Amount plus the Option Amount received by each non-employee director at each annual meeting of stockholders is equal to $\\$ 150,000$. The Compensation Committee will determine the allocation between restricted stock units and option amounts annually.\n\nA non-employee director who is initially appointed after any annual meeting of stockholders will receive a restricted stock unit award or option grant on the date of his or her initial appointment to the Board of Directors equal to the pro-rated amount of the annual grant.\n\nAnnual option grants and restricted stock unit awards (or any pro-rated grants for directors initially appointed between annual meetings) vest on the earlier to occur of the first anniversary of the date of grant or the next annual meeting of stockholders.

        "text": "utilization. The Company has approximately $\\$ 33.7$ of tax-effected state net operating loss carryforwards (without regard to federal benefit of state). Some of these net operating loss carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period, and those that do not will begin to expire in 2020 if not utilized. The state net operating loss carryforwards are primarily related to Florida and New Jersey, but the Company has smaller net operating losses in various other states. The Company has approximately $\\$ 65.6$ of tax-effected foreign net operating loss carryforwards. Some of these net operating loss carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period, and those that do not will begin to expire in 2020 if not utilized. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to the recognition of a discrete tax benefit of $\\$ 41.0$ in connection with a foreign restructuring plan allowing the future realization of net operating losses. Additionally, the Company has $\\$ 5.0$ of U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards (without regard to federal benefit of state). Some of these research and development credit carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period, and those that do not will begin to expire in 2020 if not utilized.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company determined that a total valuation allowance of $\\$ 36.3$ was necessary to reduce U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets by $\\$ 15.4$ and foreign deferred tax assets by $\\$ 20.9$, where it was more likely than not that all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2019, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized based on the Company's estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax-planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions.\nThe Company recognizes in the Consolidated Financial Statements only those tax positions determined to be \"more likely than not\" of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n\n|  | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |\n| :-- | --: | --: | --: |\n| Beginning balance | $\\$ 63.6$ | $\\$ 52.2$ | $\\$ 38.7$ |\n| Additions for tax positions of prior periods | 2.9 | 2.4 | 24.8 |\n| Additions for tax positions of the current period | 4.2 | 6.9 | 4.2 |\n| Additions due to acquisitions | 1.9 | 4.4 | - |\n| Reductions for tax positions of prior periods | $(0.3)$ | $(0.4)$ | $(11.2)$ |\n| Reductions attributable to settlements with taxing authorities | - | - | $(1.5)$ |\n| Reductions attributable to lapses of applicable statute of limitations | $(2.5)$ | $(1.9)$ | $(2.8)$ |\n| Ending balance | $\\$ 69.8$ | $\\$ 63.6$ | $\\$ 52.2$ |\n\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is $\\$ 68.2$. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were $\\$ 1.8$ in 2019 and are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties were $\\$ 8.7$ at December 31, 2019 and $\\$ 6.9$ at December 31, 2018. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by a net $\\$ 6.3$, mainly due to anticipated statute of limitations lapses in various jurisdictions.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to examinations for U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various state, city and foreign jurisdictions. The Company's federal income tax returns for 2016 through the current period remain open to examination and the relevant state, city and foreign statutes vary. The Company does not expect the assessment of any significant additional tax in excess of amounts reserved.\nThe Tax Act was signed into U.S. law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act contains provisions which impact the Company's income taxes including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from $35 \\%$ to $21 \\%$, a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation tax imposed on all undistributed foreign earnings, and the introduction of a modified territorial taxation system.\nThe SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") on December 22, 2017 to provide guidance where the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes, is incomplete for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act upon issuance of financial statements for the reporting period in which the Tax Act was enacted. SAB 118 provides that if a company could determine a reasonable estimate, that estimate should be reported as a provisional amount and adjusted during a measurement period. If a company is unable to determine a reasonable estimate, no related provisional amounts would be recorded until a reasonable estimate can be determined, within the measurement period. The measurement period extends until all necessary information has been obtained, prepared, and analyzed, but no longer than 12-months from the date of enactment of the Tax Act.\nThe Company intends to distribute all historical unremitted foreign earnings up to the amount of excess foreign cash, as well as all future foreign earnings that can be repatriated without incremental U.S. federal tax cost. Any remaining outside basis differences relating to the Company's investments in foreign subsidiaries are no longer expected to be material and will be indefinitely reinvested.\n\n# (8) LONG-TERM DEBT \n\nOn September 23, 2016, Roper entered into a five-year $\\$ 2.5$ billion unsecured credit facility, as amended December 2, 2016, (the \"2016 Facility\") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which replaced its previous $\\$ 1.85$ billion unsecured credit facility dated as of July 27, 2012, as amended as of October 28, 2015 (the \"2012 Facility\"). The 2016 Facility comprises a five year $\\$ 2.5$ billion revolving credit facility, which includes availability of up to $\\$ 150.0$ for letters of credit. Roper may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request term loans or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $\\$ 500.0$. At December 31, 2019, there were $\\$ 0.0$ of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Facility."

Trade receivables generally have 30 to 90 day terms.\n\n## AASB 9 Financial Instruments\n\nThis standard addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model based on expected credit losses for the impairment of financial assets. The Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using a simplified approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to trade receivables using a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information. Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors.\n\nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts which are known to be uncollectable are written off by reducing the carrying amount directly. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is raised when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments (more than 60 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to shortterm receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial.\n\nOther receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment.\n\n## Note 8.

Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and asset/liability studies at regular intervals.\n\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of our pension plan assets:\n\n|   | As of December 31, |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | 2019 | 2018  |\n|  Equity securities - U.S. holdings ${ }^{(4)}$ | \\$ | 24,586 \\$ 20,469  |\n|  Equity funds - U.S. holdings ${ }^{(4)(5)}$ |  | - 54  |\n|  Bond funds - government ${ }^{(4)(5)}$ |  | 33,991 19,146  |\n|  Bond funds - other ${ }^{(4)(5)}$ |  | 207,901 202,393  |\n|  Real estate ${ }^{(4)(5)}$ |  | 2,979 2,652  |\n|  Cash and cash equivalents ${ }^{(2)}$ |  | 5,700 5,866  |\n|  Partnerships ${ }^{(2)}$ |  | 7,539 9,172  |\n|  Total fair value of plan assets | \\$ | 282,696 \\$ 259,752  |\n\nThe fair values at December 31, 2019, are classified within the following categories in the fair value hierarchy:\n\n|   | Quoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets\n(Level 1) | Significant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\n(Level 2) | Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3) | Not Leveled | Total  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Equity securities - U.S. holdings ${ }^{(4)}$ | \\$ 24,586 | - | - | - | 24,586  |\n|  Bond funds - government ${ }^{(4)(5)}$ | - | - | - | 33,991 | 33,991  |\n|  Bond funds - other ${ }^{(4)(5)}$ | - | - | - | 207,901 | 207,901  |\n|  Real estate ${ }^{(4)(5)}$ | - | - | - | 2,979 | 2,979  |\n|  Cash and cash equivalents ${ }^{(2)}$ | 5,700 | - | - | - | 5,700  |\n|  Partnerships ${ }^{(2)}$ | - | - | 7,539 | - | 7,539  |\n|  Total | \\$ 30,286 | - | 7,539 | 244,871 | 282,696  |"

Balance Sheet Components\n\n### Deferred Revenue\n\nDeferred revenue relates to performance obligations for which payments have been received by the customer prior to revenue recognition. Deferred revenue primarily consists of deferred software, or amounts allocated to mobile dashboard and on-line apps and unspecified upgrade rights. Deferred revenue also includes deferred subscription-based services. The deferred software and deferred subscription-based service performance obligations are anticipated to be recognized over the useful life or service periods of one to eighteen months.\n\nChanges in the total short-term and long-term deferred revenue balance were as follows (in thousands):\n\n|   | December 31, |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | 2019 | 2018 | 2017  |\n|  Beginning balances | $36,836 | $42,432 | $49,904  |\n|  Deferral of revenue | 45,040 | 40,003 | 46,193  |\n|  Recognition of deferred revenue | (41,034) | (45,599) | (53,665)  |\n|  Ending balances | $40,842 | $36,836 | $42,432  |\n\n### Revenue Returns Reserve\n\nChanges in the revenue returns reserve were as follows (in thousands):\n\n|   | December 31, |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | 2019 | 2018 | 2017  |\n|  Beginning balances | $104,001 | $109,872 | $98,851  |\n|  Increases ^{ (1) } | 178,962 | 170,957 | 229,610  |\n|  Returns taken | (181,637) | (176,828) | (218,589)  |\n|  Ending balances | $101,326 | $104,001 | $109,872  |\n\n(1) Increases in the revenue returns reserve include provisions for open box returns and stock rotations.\n\n### Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nChanges in the allowance for doubtful accounts were as follows (in thousands):\n\n|   | December 31, |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | 2019 | 2018 | 2017(1)  |\n|  Beginning balances | $3,742 | $9,229 | $282  |\n|  Increases | 297 | 56 | 30,551  |\n|  Write-offs | (291) | (5,543) | (21,604)  |\n|  Ending balances | $3,748 | $3,742 | $9,229  |\n\n(1) Write-offs in 2017 was primarily related to the Wynit bankruptcy described in Note 7."

Included in the balance at May 26, 2019 are $\\$ 1.0$ million of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. Any associated interest and penalties imposed would affect the tax rate. As of May 27, 2018, our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $\\$ 32.5$ million, excluding a related liability of $\\$ 7.7$ million for gross interest and penalties. Interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was an expense of $\\$ 1.2$ million in fiscal 2019, an expense of $\\$ 1.6$ million in fiscal 2018, and a benefit of $\\$ 0.3$ million in fiscal 2017.\n\nThe net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018 that, if recognized, would favorably impact our effective tax rate was $\\$ 37.3$ million and $\\$ 27.8$ million, respectively.\n\nWe accrue interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense.\nWe conduct business and file tax returns in numerous countries, states, and local jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") has completed its audit of the Company for tax years through fiscal 2017. All resulting significant items for fiscal 2017 and prior years have been settled with the IRS, with the exception of fiscal 2016. Statutes of limitation for preacquisition tax years of Pinnacle generally remain open for calendar year 2002 and subsequent years principally related to net operating losses. Other major jurisdictions where we conduct business generally have statutes of limitations ranging from three to five years.\n\nWe estimate that it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to $\\$ 20.7$ million over the next twelve months due to various federal, state, and foreign audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. Of this amount, approximately $\\$ 6.7$ million would reverse through results of discontinued operations."

While a vessel is on-hire, fuel costs are typically paid by the charterer, whereas during periods of commercial waiting time, fuel costs are paid by us. The increase in voyage, charterhire and commission expenses of $\\$ 43.3$ million to $\\$ 104.5$ million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $\\$ 61.2$ million for the same period in 2017, is principally due to an increase of:\n\n- $\\$ 52.2$ million of voyage expenses that arose from the increased utilization of our vessels participating within the Cool Pool, for which we receive credit under the Cool Pool arrangement (further described in note 25(d) \"Related Parties\" of our consolidated financial statements included herein); and\n- $\\$ 3.2$ million due to the Golar Viking being taken out of lay-up.\n\nThis was partially offset by the $\\$ 12.7$ million decrease in charterhire expense relating to the charter back of the Golar Grand from Golar Partners. As the charter back of the Golar Grand was completed in November 1, 2017, there was no comparable charterhire expense in 2018.\n\nAdministrative expenses: Administrative expenses increased by $\\$ 15.4$ million to $\\$ 51.7$ million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $\\$ 36.3$ million for the same period in 2017, principally due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits (including share options expenses).\n\nProject development expenses: Project development expenses decreased by $\\$ 4.6$ million to $\\$ 5.2$ million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $\\$ 9.8$ million for the same period in 2017, principally due to a decrease in non-capitalized project-related expenses comprising of legal, professional and consultancy costs.\n\nDepreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization decreased by $\\$ 11.0$ million to $\\$ 65.5$ million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $\\$ 76.5$ million for the same period in 2017, principally due to a decrease of:\n\n- $\\$ 7.8$ million in Golar Tundra depreciation as a result of a $\\$ 9.7$ million catch-up charge recognized upon the vessel ceasing to be classified as held-for-sale in March 2017; and\n- $\\$ 3.3$ million in the Gandria depreciation as she reached the end of her useful economic life at December 31, 2017, and accordingly, no further depreciation expense was recognized in 2018.\n\nOther operating gains: This represents initial amounts recovered in connection with the ongoing arbitration proceedings arising from the delays and the termination of the Golar Tundra time charter with a former charterer.\n\nEquity in net earnings of affiliates:\n\n|  December 31, |  |  |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  (in thousands of \\$) | 2018 | 2017 | Change | \\% Change  |\n|  Share of net earnings in Golar Partners | 7,001 | 17,702 | $(10,701)$ | $(60) \\%$  |\n|  Impairment of investment in Golar Partners | $(149,389)$ | - | $(149,389)$ | $100 \\%$  |\n|  Net loss on deemed disposal of investments in Golar Partners | - | $(16,992)$ | 16,992 | $100 \\%$  |\n|  Share of net earnings in other affiliates | 3,711 | 793 | 2,918 | $368 \\%$  |\n|   | $(138,677)$ | 1,503 | $(140,180)$ | $(9,327) \\%$  |\n\nThe decrease in the share of net earnings in Golar Partners is as a result of a decrease in the underlying performance of Golar Partners in 2018. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized an impairment charge of $\\$ 149.4$ million. The year ended December 31, 2017 included a deemed loss on disposal of $\\$ 17.0$ million as a result of a dilution in our holding in Golar Partners due to further issuances of common units by Golar Partners in February 2017.

The SaaS and license revenue renewal rate represents both residential and commercial properties. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is expressed as an annualized percentage. Our service provider partners, who resell our services to our subscribers, have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with our subscribers. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is calculated across our entire subscriber base on the Alarm.com platform, including subscribers whose contract with their service provider reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, as well as subscribers whose contract with their service provider has not reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement period, and is not intended to estimate the rate at which our subscribers renew their contracts with our service provider partners. We believe that our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate allows us to measure our ability to retain and grow our SaaS and license revenue and serves as an indicator of the lifetime value of our subscriber base. |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  (4) We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net income before interest expense, interest income, other income, net, provision for / (benefit from) income taxes, amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and legal costs and settlement fees incurred in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and other disputes, particularly costs involved in ongoing intellectual property litigation. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The non-cash items include amortization and depreciation expense and stock-based compensation expense. Included in 2015 stock-based compensation expense is $0.8 million related to the repurchase of an employee's stock awards. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. See the table below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this report because it is a key measure that our management uses to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to generate future operating plans, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and to make investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, as performance measures under our executive bonus plan. Further, we believe the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related expense and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) Adjusted EBITDA does |  |  |  |  |   |"

        "text": "# Table of Contents \n\nInterest income increased by $\\$ 16.9$ million in fiscal year 2019. The increase in our interest income is associated with the increase in invested funds, primarily as a result of proceeds of approximately $\\$ 600$ million related to the common stock and convertible note offering in March 2018 and, to a lesser extent, higher yields on those invested funds.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense includes both stated interest and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs associated with the $\\$ 400.0$ million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Senior Notes that were issued in March 2018. Accordingly, interest expense in fiscal year 2019 is higher than fiscal year 2018 as the notes were only outstanding for part of fiscal year 2018.\n\nInterest expense increased $\\$ 10.9$ million in fiscal year 2019, compared to the same period a year ago. Interest expense for fiscal year 2019 consists of noncash interest expense of $\\$ 12.2$ million related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and stated interest of $\\$ 5.0$ million.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on monetary asset and monetary liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity in which they are recorded. We currently have entities with a functional currency of the Argentine Peso, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, and Polish Zloty.\n\nWe realized a net currency exchange loss of $\\$ 1.9$ million in fiscal year 2019 as compared to a net currency exchange gain of $\\$ 0.5$ million in fiscal year 2018 as a result of exchange rate movements on foreign currency denominated accounts against the US Dollar.\n\n## Provision for Income Taxes\n\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States as well as other tax jurisdictions and countries in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to current U.S. income tax.\n\n|  | Fiscal years ended July 31, |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | 2019 |  | 2018 |  | Change |\n|  | Amount |  | Amount | (S) | (\\%) |\n|  | (In thousands, except percentages) |  |  |  |  |\n| Provision for (benefit from) income taxes | \\$ | $(8,280)$ | \\$ | 18,467 | $(26,747)$ |\n| Effective tax rate |  | $(66) \\%$ |  | $(223) \\%$ |  |\n\nWe recognized an income tax benefit of $\\$ 8.3$ million for fiscal year 2019 compared to an income tax provision of $\\$ 18.5$ million for fiscal year 2018. The fiscal year 2018 income tax provision was primarily due to a one-time provisional net charge from re-measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities in the quarter ended January 31, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The effective tax rate of ( $66) \\%$ for fiscal year 2019, differs from the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate of $21 \\%$ mainly due to permanent differences for stock-based compensation, including excess tax benefits, research and development credits, the tax rate differences between the United States and foreign countries, foreign withholding taxes, and certain non-deductible expenses including executive compensation.\n\nAs of July 31, 2019, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $\\$ 6.2$ million that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law which substantially changed U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate to $21 \\%$ effective January 1,2018 and several provisions that may impact us in current and future periods. The Tax Act includes a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") of foreign subsidiaries, a special deduction for foreign-derived intangible income, and a base erosion anti-abuse tax (\"BEAT\") measure that taxes certain payments between a U.S. corporation and its foreign subsidiaries. These provisions of the Tax Act became effective for us beginning on August 1, 2018 and had no impact on the tax benefit for fiscal year 2019.\n\nUnder GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We have elected the current period expense method.\n\nIn December 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") issued proposed regulations related to the BEAT tax, which we are in the process of evaluating. If the proposed BEAT regulations are finalized in their current form, the impact may be material to the tax provision in the quarter of enactment.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. We continue to obtain, analyze, and interpret guidance"

Cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and component costs, labor costs and overhead. In fiscal 2019 and 2018, approximately 89% of the total cost of sales was variable in nature and fluctuated with sales volumes. Of these amounts, approximately 86% and 88% of these costs in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, were related to material and component costs.\n\nAs compared to fiscal 2018, the increase in cost of sales in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and increased fixed costs to support program ramps. Partially offsetting the increase was a positive shift in customer mix and the $13.5 million one-time employee bonus (the \"one-time employee bonus\") that was paid during fiscal 2018, of which $12.6 million impacted cost of sales in that period.\n\n*Gross profit.* Gross profit for fiscal 2019 increased $34.2 million, or 13.3%, as compared to fiscal 2018. Gross margin of 9.2% increased by 20 basis points as compared to fiscal 2018. The primary driver of the increases in gross profit and gross margin as compared to fiscal 2018 was the increase in net sales, a positive shift in customer mix and the one-time employee bonus that was paid during fiscal 2018.\n\n*Operating income.* Operating income for fiscal 2019 increased $23.8 million, or 20.1%, as compared to fiscal 2018 as a result of the increase in gross profit as well as the non-recurrence of the one-time employee bonus that was paid during fiscal 2018, as noted above. This was partially offset by an $8.8 million increase in selling and administrative expenses, driven by a $4.9 million increase in compensation expense, and $1.7 million of restructuring costs. Operating margin of 4.5% increased 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in gross margin as a result of the factors discussed above.\n\nA discussion of operating income by reportable segment is presented below (in millions):\n\n|   | 2019 | 2018  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Operating income (loss): |  |   |\n|  AMER | $57.8 | $38.6  |\n|  APAC | 208.2 | 213.9  |\n|  EMEA | 4.5 | 1.5  |\n|  Corporate and other costs | (128.4) | (135.7)  |\n|  Total operating income | $142.1 | $118.3  |\n\n*AMER.* Operating income increased $19.2 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of the increase in net sales and a positive shift in customer mix, partially offset by increased fixed costs to support new program ramps.\n\n*APAC.* Operating income decreased $5.7 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of a negative shift in customer mix and increased fixed costs to support new program ramps, partially offset by the increase in net sales.\n\n*EMEA.* Operating income increased $3.0 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the increase in net sales and a positive shift in customer mix, partially offset by increased fixed costs to support new program ramps.\n\n*Other expense.* Other expense for fiscal 2019 increased $5.4 million as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in other expense for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a $2.7 million decrease in interest income as a result of lower cash balances and a $1.5 million increase in factoring fees related to the Company's accounts receivable sale programs."

In addition to all Real locations, the hypermarket business also includes companies providing procurement and online services for Real as well as real estate and a supplier. Together, the assets and liabilities have been treated as discontinued operations within the meaning of IFRS 5 since September 2018. In view of the progress of the divestment process and the expected completion of the sale in the near future, the hypermarket business as of 30 September 2019 will continue to be classified as a discontinued operation until its deconsolidation.\n\n## Profit or loss for the period after taxes\n\nThe current result of the hypermarket business, together with all related consolidation entries recognised in the income statement, was shown in a separate section in the consolidated income statement as 'profit or loss for the period from discontinued operations after taxes'. To increase the economic meaningfulness of the earnings statement of the continued sector, its shares in the consolidation effects were also included in the discontinuing section of the earnings statement as far as they were related to business relations that are to be upheld in the long term even after the planned disposal."

Coronavirus (COVID-19) Impact\n\nThe worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus is expected to result in a global slowdown of economic activity which is likely to decrease demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including from our customers, while also disrupting sales channels, marketing activities and supply chains for an unknown period of time until the disease is contained. We expect this to have a negative impact on our sales and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we are required to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying disclosures. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and therefore require the exercise of judgment. As of the date of issuance of the financial statements, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require us to update our estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to our financial statements.\n\n## ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM 9A.

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to"

        "text": "# Strategic report \n\n## Financial review continued\n\nFinance income and costs continued Finance costs in 2019 were $\\$ 1.8$ million (2018 \\$0.1 million), $\\$ 1.7$ million of which related to interest on lease liabilities following the implementation of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe adjusted effective tax rate, being the adjusted tax charge expressed as a percentage of adjusted profit before tax, shown on the face of the consolidated income statement, was 13.0 per cent in 2019, down from 15.4 per cent in 2018.\n\nSpirent's effective tax rate has benefited from a combination of factors in 2019, including the ratification of a new tax treaty between India and Hong Kong, and an increase in non-taxed income. Additionally, the Group received tax benefits from the United Kingdom Patent Box Scheme, the United States R\\&D Tax Credit, and a current year recognition of deferred tax assets in the United States.\n\nGoing forward it is anticipated that Spirent's effective tax rate will be maintained at around 13-14 per cent, subject to changes in tax legislation.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nAdjusted basic earnings per share was up 23.4 per cent to 13.40 cents (2018 10.86 cents). Basic earnings per share was 12.79 cents (2018 9.14 cents). There were 609.9 million (2018 610.4 million) weighted average Ordinary Shares in issue. See note 11 of Notes to the full year consolidated financial statements on page 142 for the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n## Treasury management\n\nThe key objective of the Group's treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available for the Group. All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework. The Board has approved treasury policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities. Additionally, it is the Group's policy that speculative treasury transactions are expressly forbidden.\n\nSpirent's financial risk management objectives and policies and its exposure to risks are discussed in note 30 of Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Financing and cash flow\n\nThe Group delivered very strong cash generation in 2019, driven by higher operating profit and effective working\ncapital management. Changes in working capital, reflected within cash flow from operations, benefited from:\n\n- our continued focus on improving trade receivables collection;\n- a reduction in inventory levels due to a high level of shipments at the end of 2019; and\n- growth in payables, resulting from the increase in activity levels and emphasis on extending supplier payment terms.\n\nFree cash flow for 2019 almost doubled year-on-year coming in at $\\$ 100.1$ million, compared to $\\$ 50.9$ million in 2018, resulting in a free cash flow conversion which represented 123 per cent of adjusted earnings ( 201877 per cent).\n\nFree cash flow is set out below:\n\n| \\$ million | 2019 | 2018 |\n| :-- | --: | --: |\n| Cash flow from operations | 124.9 | 65.9 |\n| Tax paid | $(5.6)$ | $(5.7)$ |\n| Net cash inflow from operating activities | 119.3 | 60.2 |\n| Interest received | 2.6 | 1.3 |\n| Net capital expenditure | $(11.9)$ | $(10.6)$ |\n| Payment of lease liabilities, principal and interest ${ }^{1}$ | $(10.3)$ | - |\n| Lease payments received from finance leases | 0.4 | - |\n| Free cash flow | 100.1 | 50.9 |\n\nNote\n\n1. Spirent adopted IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019; in prior periods operating lease payments were included within cash flow from operations.\n\nFree cash flow includes a net cash outflow in respect of exceptional items in 2018 and 2019 of $\\$ 5.5$ million (2018 $\\$ 3.6$ million in respect of exceptional items charged in 2017 and 2018).\nTax payments of $\\$ 5.6$ million made in 2019 were consistent with the prior year (2018 $\\$ 5.7$ million). Net capital expenditure of $\\$ 11.9$ million was also broadly consistent with the prior year (2018 \\$10.6 million), with the incremental spend of $\\$ 1.3$ million primarily related to investment in 5G. We continue to exercise careful management of capital investment to ensure efficient use of capital and maximise return on investment.\n\nFollowing the adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, the payment of lease liabilities, both the principal and interest elements, are shown separately from net cash flow from operating activities. In previous periods they would have been reflected in that number. There is no overall impact in comparing free cash flow year-on-year.\nIn 2019, the final dividend for 2018 and an interim dividend for 2019 totalling $\\$ 28.6$ million were paid. This compared to total dividends of $\\$ 54.8$ million paid in 2018, including a special dividend of $\\$ 29.9$ million. In addition, 4.0 million shares were purchased and placed into the Employee Share Ownership Trust at a cost of $\\$ 8.6$ million (2018 1.5 million shares at a net cost of $\\$ 2.5$ million) and $\\$ 1.9$ million of cash consideration was paid to acquire the business of a navigation systems company based in the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing these payments, cash and cash equivalents closed at $\\$ 183.2$ million at 31 December 2019, compared with $\\$ 121.6$ million at 31 December 2018. There continues to be no bank debt.\n\n## Defined benefit pension plans\n\nThe Group operates two funded defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom, both of which were closed to new entrants.\n\nThe accounting valuation of the funded defined benefit pension plans at 31 December 2019 gave rise to a net surplus of $\\$ 11.6$ million, compared with a net surplus of $\\$ 2.5$ million at 31 December 2018. The 31 December 2019 position has benefited from contributions paid to the plans in the year of $\\$ 6.6$ million (2018 $\\$ 6.8$ million) together with a return on pension plan assets in excess of the increase in plan liabilities, the latter arising primarily from a reduction in discount rate.\n\nThe latest triennial actuarial valuation dated 31 March 2018 indicated a deficit of $\u00a3 22.5$ million, calculated on a technical provisions basis using more prudent assumptions"

        "text": "# (ii) Performance obligations \n\nThe transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognised. They include amounts recognised as unearned revenue and amounts that are contracted but not yet billed or performed.\n\nThe transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as at 30 June 2019, is $\\$ 121,449,000$. This amount mostly comprises obligations in our long-term contracts to provide software or 'software-as-a-service' (SaaS) support and maintenance, open long-term professional services contracts as well as licences contracted but not yet earned as the licence has not yet been deployed. Most of this amount is expected to be recognised as revenue beyond the next 12 months following the respective balance sheet date. This estimation is judgemental, as it needs to consider estimates of possible future contract modifications. The amount of transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, and changes in this amount over time, are impacted by, among others, currency fluctuations and the remaining contract period of our billing solution agreements (which, in some cases, are contracted until 5 years after balance sheet date).\n\nRevenue recognised in the current reporting period aligned to performance obligations satisfied in earlier periods was $\\$ 14,059,000$, mainly resulting from the increased usage of software licences already delivered during the reporting period.\n(iii) Contract balances\n\n|  | 2019 | 2018 |\n| :-- | --: | --: |\n|  | $\\$ 000$ | $\\$ 000$ |\n| Accrued revenue | 27,817 | 5,824 |\n| Unearned revenue | 27,069 | 22,914 |\n\nIncreases in the balance of accrued and unearned revenue during the year relate to the acquisition of Sigma Systems (refer to Note 24). Additionally, the increase in accrued revenue was a result of software licences deployed on contract inception but have yet to be billed to the customer.\n\nRevenues recognised in the current reporting period that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the reporting period was $\\$ 22,251,000$, representing support and maintenance performed during the period.\n\n## b. Government grants\n\nIncluded in other income during the financial year is $\\$ 309,000$ (2018: $\\$ 593,000$ ) related to government grants receivable to compensate for eligible employee expenditure related to research activities performed in Norway. There are no unfulfilled conditions or contingencies attached to these grants.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Revenue\n\nThe Group derives revenues from customer contracts associated with the provision of billing solutions. A typical contract may include various deliverables in consideration for fees. Such deliverables in our contracts include, but are not limited to, the provision of a software licence, support and maintenance services, as well as professional implementation and customisation services.\n\nThe nature of fee structures within the contracts varies by customer. The timing and frequency of invoicing depends on the terms and conditions of each contract. Invoices are billed to the customer either in advance or in arrears on normal commercial terms. Where the contract requires invoicing in advance, revenue is initially deferred as unearned revenue until the Group fulfils its performance obligations. Where the contract requires invoicing in arrears, revenue recognised on fulfilment of a performance obligation is brought to account as accrued revenue, until the Group's right to consideration becomes unconditional and the accrued revenue is then presented as a receivable.\nThe Group's accounting policies with respect to each of the individual deliverables in the Group's customer contracts are outlined in sub-sections (i) onwards.\n\n## (i) Licence, support and maintenance revenue\n\nThe Group's contracts for billing solutions regularly include software licences associated with the relevant billing solution provided to the customer. The nature of the licence varies by customer and billing solution. As part of the licence agreement, various support and maintenance services are available to support the customer's use of the billing solution. This includes the provision of various bug fixes, updates and helpdesk support."

The Company reports TCE earnings because we believe it provides additional meaningful information to investors in relation to revenue, the most directly comparable IFRS measure. TCE earnings is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance irrespective of changes in the mix of charter types (i.e. spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. Below is presented a reconciliation from Revenue to TCE earnings:\n\n|  USDm | 2019 | 2018 | 2017  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Reconciliation to revenue |  |  |   |\n|  Revenue | 692.6 | 635.4 | 657.0  |\n|  Port expenses, bunkers and commissions | $-267.7$ | $-283.0$ | $-259.9$  |\n|  TCE earnings | 424.9 | 352.4 | 397.1  |\n\nGross profit: TORM defines Gross profit, a performance measure, as revenue less port expenses, bunkers and commissions, charter hire and operating expenses. The Company reports Gross profit because we believe it provides additional meaningful information to investors, as Gross profit measures the net earnings from shipping activities. Gross profit is calculated as follows:\n\n|  USDm | 2019 | 2018 | 2017  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Reconciliation to revenue |  |  |   |\n|  Revenue | 692.6 | 635.4 | 657.0  |\n|  Port expenses, bunkers and commissions | $-267.7$ | $-283.0$ | $-259.9$  |\n|  Charter hire | - | $-2.5$ | $-8.5$  |\n|  Operating expenses | $-173.0$ | $-180.4$ | $-188.4$  |\n|  Gross profit | 251.9 | 169.5 | 200.2  |\n\nNet interest-bearing debt: Net interest-bearing debt is defined as borrowings (current and noncurrent) less loans receivables and cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash. Net interest-bearing debt depicts the net capital resources, which cause net interest expenditure and interest rate risk and which, together with equity, are used to finance the Company's investments. As such, TORM believes that net interest-bearing debt is a relevant measure which Management uses to measure the overall development of the use of financing, other than equity. Such measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Net interest-bearing debt is calculated as follows:\n\n|  USDm | 2019 | 2018 | 2017  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Borrowings | 863.4 | 754.7 | 753.9  |\n|  Loans receivables | -4.6 | - | -  |\n|  Cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash | -72.5 | -127.4 | -134.2  |\n|  Net interest-bearing debt | 786.3 | 627.3 | 619.7  |"

Net sales decreased in North America by $\\$ 15.1$ million to $\\$ 70.9$ million in fiscal 2018, primarily due to the exit of our Connectivity business in fiscal 2017. Net sales in Europe decreased $\\$ 1.7$ million to $\\$ 0.3$ million in fiscal 2018 due to lower sales volumes and price reductions on certain of our data solutions products. Net sales in Asia decreased $\\$ 1.5$ million to $\\$ 2.0$ million in fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower sales volumes of legacy products.\n\nGross Profit. Interface segment gross profit decreased $\\$ 3.5$ million, or $19.7 \\%$, to $\\$ 14.3$ million in fiscal 2018, compared to $\\$ 17.8$ million in fiscal 2017. The decrease was due to lower sales volumes as a result of the exit of our Connectivity business in fiscal 2017 and price reductions on certain products.\n\nIncome from Operations. Interface segment income from operations was $\\$ 6.0$ million in fiscal 2018, compared to $\\$ 4.0$ million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to a favorable sales mix, lower expenses related to the Connectivity business, lower legal expenses and lower stock-based compensation expense, partially offset with lower sales volumes and pricing reductions on certain products.\n\n## Medical Segment Results\n\nBelow is a table summarizing results for the fiscal years ended:\n\n| (Dollars in Millions) | April 28, <br> 2018 | April 29, <br> 2017 | Net Change (\\$) | Net Change (\\%) |\n| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |\n| Net Sales | $\\$ 0.3$ | $\\$ 0.2$ | $\\$ 0.1$ | $50.0 \\%$ |\n| Gross Profit | $\\$ (3.5)$ | $\\$ (3.1)$ | $\\$ (0.4)$ | $(12.9) \\%$ |\n| Loss from Operations | $\\$ (11.4)$ | $\\$ (8.5)$ | $\\$ (2.9)$ | $(34.1) \\%$ |\n\nNet Sales.

Medical segment gross profit was a loss of $\\$ 3.5$ million in fiscal 2018 compared to a loss of $\\$ 3.1$ million in fiscal 2017. The increased loss primarily relates to the vertical manufacturing integration of some key components and research efforts to expand the product offerings.\n\nLoss from Operations. Medical segment loss from operations increased $\\$ 2.9$ million to $\\$ 11.4$ million in fiscal 2018 compared to $\\$ 8.5$ million in fiscal 2017.

For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the valuation allowance increased by $\\$ 7.1$ million and $\\$ 6.2$ million, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $\\$ 193.8$ million and $\\$ 185.0$ million, respectively, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $\\$ 84.6$ million and $\\$ 75.3$ million, respectively.

The AASB equivalent of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contract with Customers replaced IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.\n\nThe new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer - either over time or at a point in time - depending on when performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nThe Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using the modified retrospective approach with changes reflected in opening retained profits. The application of the standard did not result in a significant change to the recognition of revenue compared to the previous accounting policy for revenue.\n\nAltium has one performance obligation for each of the revenue streams listed below and has applied the following revenue recognition methods:\n\n1. Software licenses: Revenue is recognised at a point in time when license activation is available to the user.\n2. Subscription and maintenance: Revenue is deferred and is subsequently recognised over the period in which the subscription service is provided. As the billing structure for customers is often bundled with licenses and billed on activation, there is an allocation methodology applied based on stand-alone selling prices to calculate the portion of revenue to be deferred.\n3. Search advertising: Revenue is recognised at a point in time on a price-per-click basis, this is when a user engages with the search result on the website by clicking on it.\n4. Services revenue: Revenue from providing services is recognised over the period in which the services are rendered. Services include training and implementation services.\n5. Other revenue - Royalties: Royalties related to IP are recognised at a point in time when the subsequent sales occurs.\n6. Interest income: Revenue is recognised on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the assets net carrying amount.\n\n## Impact on opening retained profits\n\nFor incremental costs incurred in obtaining a contract, such as sales commissions, Altium has chosen to apply the practical expedient available under the standard which permits immediate expensing when the underlying asset is amortised in one year or less, given subscription periods are typically for a 12 month period.\n\nWhere revenue is deferred for more than 12 months and an upfront commission has been paid, the commission is capitalised and amortised over the period the revenue is recognised. Altium had US\\$6 million in long-term deferred revenue as at 30 June 2018 which resulted in an adjustment of US $\\$ 0.3$ million to opening retained profits on adoption of the standard.\n\nAltium had US $\\$ 6.9$ million in long-term deferred revenue as at June 2019 which resulted in an adjustment of US $\\$ 0.2$ million to capitalise commissions.\n\nCritical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nRevenue for multiple element contracts is allocated based on stand-alone selling prices and then recognised revenue according to the accounting policy for each revenue stream."

In 2019, gains on the sale of company-operated restaurants were related to the extension of the underlying franchise and lease agreements from restaurants sold in prior years. Refer to Note 3, Summary of Refranchisings, Franchisee Development and Acquisitions, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these gains.\n\n## Interest Expense, Net\n\nInterest expense, net, is comprised of the following in each fiscal year (in thousands):\n\n|   | 2019 | 2018  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Interest expense | \\$ 86,027 | \\$ 46,525  |\n|  Interest income | $(1,060)$ | $(978)$  |\n|  Interest expense, net | \\$ 84,967 | \\$ 45,547  |\n\nInterest expense, net, increased $\\$ 39.4$ million in 2019 as compared to a year ago primarily due to a charge of $\\$ 23.6$ million from the early termination of our interest rate swaps, as well as an increase in average interest rates and outstanding borrowings, resulting in higher interest costs of approximately $\\$ 8.4$ million and $\\$ 3.1$ million, respectively. Additionally, as a result of our retirement of our credit facility in 2019, we recorded a $\\$ 2.8$ million loss on early extinguishment of debt, primarily consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. Refer to Note 7, Indebtedness, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our refinancing transaction.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nOur tax rate for our fiscal year ended September 29, 2019 was impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. As a fiscal year taxpayer, the corporate federal rate reduction from $35 \\%$ to $21 \\%$ was phased in, resulting in a statutory federal tax rate of $24.5 \\%$ for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, and $21.0 \\%$ for our fiscal year ended September 29, 2019 and subsequent fiscal years."

We expect the cash flow from our operations, combined with existing cash and amounts available under the revolving credit facility, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements, restructuring obligations, dividend payments and capital spending over the next year. In addition, we may, from time to time, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities (including any publicly issued debt securities) in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise."

The remaining increase was principally the result of a $1.8 million increase in trade show and advertising costs and a $0.8 million increase attributed to office related expenses to support the sales team.

        "text": "# ON SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION <br> NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n\n## Plan Descriptions\n\nOn March 23, 2010, the Company adopted the Amended and Restated SIP, which was subsequently approved by the Company's stockholders at the annual stockholder meeting on May 18, 2010 and reapproved by the Company's stockholders at the annual stockholder meeting on May 20, 2015. The Amended and Restated SIP provides key employees, directors and consultants with various equity-based incentives as described in the plan document. The Amended and Restated SIP is administered by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, which is authorized to determine, among other things, the key employees, directors or consultants who will receive awards under the plan, the amount and type of award, exercise prices or performance criteria, if applicable, and vesting schedules. On May 15, 2012, stockholders approved certain amendments to the Amended and Restated SIP to increase the number of shares of common stock subject to all awards under the Amended and Restated SIP by 33.0 million. On May 17, 2017, stockholders approved certain amendments to the Amended and Restated SIP to increase the number of shares of common stock subject to all awards under the Amended and Restated SIP by 27.9 million to 87.0 million, exclusive of shares of common stock subject to awards that were previously granted pursuant to the 2000 SIP that have or will become available for grant pursuant to the Amended and Restated SIP.\n\nGenerally, RSUs granted under the Amended and Restated SIP vest over three years or based on the achievement of certain performance or market-based conditions and are payable in shares of the Company's stock upon vesting. The options granted under the Amended and Restated SIP vest over a period of three to four years and have a contractual term of seven years. Under the plan, certain outstanding options vest automatically upon a change of control, as defined in the plan document, provided the option holder is employed by the Company on the date of the change of control. Certain other outstanding options may also vest upon a change of control if the Board of Directors of the Company, at its discretion, provides for acceleration of the vesting of said options. Generally, upon the termination of an option holder's employment, all unvested options will immediately terminate and vested options will generally remain exercisable for a period of 90 days after the date of termination (one year in the case of death or disability).\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, there was an aggregate of 25.5 million shares of common stock available for grant under the Amended and Restated SIP.\n\n## Stock Options\n\nThe number of options outstanding at December 31, 2018 was 0.3 million at a weighted average exercise price of $\\$ 6.41$ per option, of which 0.3 million options were exercised at a weighted average exercise price of $\\$ 6.37$ per option during the year ended December 31, 2019. There were an insignificant number of options outstanding as of December 31, 2019, at a weighted average exercise price of $\\$ 8.19$ per option and had an aggregate intrinsic value of $\\$ 0.2$ million. All outstanding options had exercise prices below $\\$ 24.38$ per share, the closing price of the Company's common stock at December 31, 2019, and will expire at varying times between 2020 and 2021.\n\n## Restricted Stock Units\n\nA summary of the RSU transactions for the year ended December 31, 2019 are as follows (number of shares in millions):\n\n|  | Number of Shares | Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Nonvested shares of RSUs at December 31, 2018 | 8.6 | \\$ 16.59 |\n| Granted | 5.4 | 21.64 |\n| Achieved | 0.2 | 24.46 |\n| Released | $(4.8)$ | 14.41 |\n| Canceled | $(0.5)$ | 19.74 |\n| Nonvested shares of RSUs at December 31, 2019 | 8.9 | 20.84 |\n\nDuring 2019, the Company awarded 2.6 million RSUs to certain officers and employees of the Company that vest upon the achievement of certain performance criteria and market conditions. The number of units expected to vest is evaluated each reporting period and compensation expense is recognized for those units for which achievement of the performance criteria is considered probable. Compensation expense for RSUs with market conditions are recognized based on the grant date fair value"

        "text": "Sales to the Energy market of $\\$ 181.7$ million reflected a 24 percent increase from fiscal year 2018. Excluding surcharge revenue, sales increased 18 percent. The results were driven by revenue and volume increases during the first half of the fiscal year in the oil and gas sub-market, particularly rental and replacement activity through our Amega West Services (\"Amega West\") business, and higher demand for materials used in power generation applications.\n\nTransportation market sales remained flat from fiscal year 2018 at $\\$ 157.7$ million. Excluding surcharge revenue, sales decreased 1 percent on 6 percent lower shipment volume. The results reflect a strengthening of heavy-duty truck applications, partially offset by trade actions and global economic uncertainty.\n\nIndustrial and Consumer market sales increased 2 percent to $\\$ 371.5$ million for fiscal year 2019. Excluding surcharge revenue, sales increased 1 percent on 4 percent lower shipment volume. The results reflect the impact of stronger demand for materials used in consumer goods including the sporting sub-market.\n\n# Gross Profit \n\nGross profit in fiscal year 2019 increased to $\\$ 444.8$ million, or 18.7 percent of net sales from $\\$ 382.3$ million, or 17.7 percent of net sales for fiscal year 2018. Excluding the impact of the surcharge revenue, our gross margin in fiscal year 2019 was 22.9 percent compared to 21.3 percent in fiscal year 2018. The results reflect the impact of improved product mix coupled with capacity gains and operating cost reductions compared to the same period a year ago. Fiscal year 2019 also reflects an $\\$ 11.4$ million benefit related to an insurance recovery in our third fiscal quarter.\n\nOur surcharge mechanism is structured to recover increases in raw material costs, although in certain cases with a lag effect as discussed above. While the surcharge generally protects the absolute gross profit dollars, it does have a dilutive effect on gross margin as a percent of sales. The following represents a summary of the dilutive impact of the surcharge on gross margin. We present and discuss these financial measures because management believes removing the impact of surcharge provides a more consistent and meaningful basis for comparing results of operations from period to period. See the section \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for further discussion of these financial measures.\n\n|  | Fiscal Year |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| (\\$ in millions) | 2019 | 2018 |\n| Net sales | \\$ 2,380.2 | \\$ 2,157.7 |\n| Less: surcharge revenue | 438.1 | 365.4 |\n| Net sales excluding surcharge revenue | \\$ 1,942.1 | \\$ 1,792.3 |\n| Gross profit | \\$ 444.8 | \\$ 382.3 |\n| Gross margin | $18.7 \\%$ | $17.7 \\%$ |\n| Gross margin excluding surcharge revenue | $22.9 \\%$ | $21.3 \\%$ |\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2019 were $\\$ 203.4$ million, or 8.5 percent of net sales ( 10.5 percent of net sales excluding surcharge revenue), compared to $\\$ 193.0$ million, or 8.9 percent of net sales ( 10.8 percent of net sales excluding surcharge revenue), in fiscal year 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to higher depreciation, insurance and acquisition related costs partially offset by lower variable compensation expense compared to fiscal year 2018.\n\n## Operating Income\n\nOur operating income in fiscal year 2019 increased to $\\$ 241.4$ million, or 10.1 percent of net sales as compared with $\\$ 189.3$ million, or 8.8 percent of net sales in fiscal year 2018. Excluding surcharge revenue and special items, adjusted operating margin was 12.5 percent for the fiscal year 2019 and 10.6 percent for the same period a year ago. The increase in the operating margin reflects steady demand and improved product mix coupled with operating cost improvements offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses compared to the same period a year ago."

The extent to which awards vest will depend upon the Group's performance over the three-year period following the award date. Both market based and non-market based performance conditions may be attached to the options, for which an appropriate adjustment is made when calculating the fair value of an option. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest, unless under exceptional circumstances.\n\nOn 17 August 2018, the Group awarded 452,695 nil cost options under the PSP scheme. For the 2018 awards, the Group's performance is measured by reference to the growth in Operating profit ( $75 \\%$ of the award) and growth in Revenue ( $25 \\%$ of the award) over the three-year period April 2018 - March 2021. For previous awards, the Group's performance had been measured by reference to the cumulative profit measure (Underlying operating profit for 2015 and 2016 awards, and Operating profit for 2017 awards) and total shareholder return relative to the FTSE 250 share index."

In this event EPRA NAV per share would have been 143 pence.\n\n## Debt measures\n\n|   | Notes | 2019 | 2018 | Change  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Debt to assets ratio | A | 67.8\\% | $53.1 \\%$ | $14.7 \\%$  |\n|  Interest cover | B | 1.67 x | 1.91 x | $-0.24 x$  |\n|  Weighted average debt maturity |  | 5.0 years | 5.8 years | -0.8 years  |\n|  Weighted average cost of gross debt (excluding RCF) |  | 4.3\\% | 4.2\\% | $-0.1 \\%$  |\n|  Proportion of gross debt with interest rate protection |  | 88\\% | 84\\% | $4 \\%$  |\n|  Immediately available cash and facilities | C | $\u00a3 241.5 \\mathrm{~m}$ | $\u00a3 246.8 \\mathrm{~m}$ | $\u00a3(5.3) \\mathrm{m}$  |\n\n## A Debt to asset ratio\n\nOur debt to assets ratio increased to 67.8 per cent in 2019 due to the property revaluation deficit in the year. This reduces to 65.3 per cent when adjusted for expected disposal proceeds from intu Puerto Venecia and intu Asturias.\n\n## B Interest cover\n\nInterest cover of 1.67 x remains above our target minimum level of 1.60 x although it has reduced in 2019 as a result of the reduction in net rental income.\n\n## C Immediately available cash and facilities\n\nImmediately available cash and facilities has reduced in the year by $\u00a3 5.3$ million to $\u00a3 241.5$ million at 31 December 2019. This excludes the rents collected at the end of December 2019 which relate to the first quarter of 2020 and remain in the debt structures until interest payments are made. At 10 March 2020, immediately available cash and facilities is $\u00a3 200.3$ million, which will be augmented by the intu Puerto Venecia sales proceeds expected to be received in early April.\n\n## Financing\n\nCentral to our strategy is fixing the balance sheet, with the key aim to increase short-term liquidity and increase headroom to deal with any potential covenant breaches and the upcoming financing activity, from early 2021 onwards.\n\n## Disposals\n\nIn the year we completed or agreed $\u00a3 469.4$ million of asset disposals:\n\n- part disposal of intu Derby completed for $\u00a3 186.3$ million\n- disposed of $\u00a3 82.1$ million of sundry assets, including Sprucefield retail park ( $\u00a3 40.0$ million), Waterfront business park at intu Merry Hill ( $\u00a3 15.5$ million) and King George V dock (see note 35 for further details)\n- exchanged contracts on the disposal of intu Puerto Venecia for $\u00a3 201.0$ million ( $\u20ac 237.7$ million)\n\nSince the year end we have announced and completed the sale of intu Asturias for $\u00a3 122.6$ million ( $\u20ac 145.0$ million)."

Under the credit facility, the Company may not exceed a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of $50 \\%$. The Company has a one-time right, at any time during the term of the agreement, to increase the maximum debt to total capitalization ratio then in effect by five percentage points in connection with the construction of a new poultry complex for the four fiscal quarters beginning on the first day of the fiscal quarter during which the Company gives written notice of its intent to exercise this right.

Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and the differences could be material. Descriptions of accounting estimates the Company considers critical follow.\n\n## Inventories\n\nProcessed and prepared inventories and inventories of feed, eggs, medication and packaging supplies are stated at the lower of cost (average method) or net realizable value. When market prices for poultry are low and feed grains are high, the Company may be required to write down the carrying values of processed poultry and live inventories to net realizable value, which would increase the Company's cost of sales."

The decrease was primarily due to decreases in payroll-related expenses of $11.8 million due to lower headcount, prototype expenses of $3.9 million due to timing of projects, depreciation expense of $2.6 million as a result of certain machinery and equipment reaching the end of their useful lives, occupancy expenses of $2.1 million from terminated leases, outside services of $0.6 million, and travel-related expenses of $0.4 million.\n\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future as we continue to focus on expanding our product portfolio and enhancing existing products.\n\n*Selling, General and Administrative*\n\n|   | Year Ended December 31, |  | % Change  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | 2019 | 2018 | 2019  |\n|   | (dollars in thousands) |  |   |\n|  Selling, general and administrative | $88,762 | $101,789 | (13)%  |\n|  % of net revenue | 28% | 26% |   |\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $13.0 million to $88.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in intangible asset amortization of $8.9 million as certain assets reached the end of their useful lives, as well as decreases in payroll-related expense of $1.7 million due to lower headcount, professional fees of $1.3 million, outside services of $0.5 million, and travel-related expenses of $0.3 million.\n\nWe expect selling, general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat in the near-term; however, our expenses may increase in the future as we expand our sales and marketing organization to enable market expansion."

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS \n\n## Reglan ${ }^{\\circledR} /$ Metoclopramide Litigation\n\nHalsey Drug Company, as predecessor to us, was named along with numerous other companies as a defendant in cases filed in three separate state coordinated litigations pending in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California, respectively captioned In re: Reglan\u00ae/Metoclopramide Mass Tort Litigation, Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, January Term, 2010, No. 01997; In re: Reglan Litigation, Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County, Case No. 289, Master Docket No. ATL-L-3865-10; and Reglan/Metoclopramide Cases, Superior Court of California, San Francisco County, Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding No. 4631, Superior Court No.: CJC-10-004631. In addition, we were served with a similar complaint by two individual plaintiffs in Nebraska federal court, which plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed in December 2014. In this product liability litigation against numerous pharmaceutical product manufacturers and distributors, including Acura, plaintiffs claim injuries from their use of the Reglan brand of metoclopramide and generic metoclopramide.\n\nNone of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed to date have confirmed that they ingested any of the generic metoclopramide manufactured by us. We discontinued manufacture and distribution of generic metoclopramide more than 20 years ago. All of these lawsuits have been effectively dismissed with the exception of less than ten pending Philadelphia cases that we expect will be finally dismissed without the need for any action by us. We expect that the Court will finally dismiss the small number of remaining Pennsylvania-based cases against us with prejudice by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Legal fees related to this matter have been covered by our insurance carrier. Based upon the current status and evaluation, we have not accrued for any potential loss related to these matters as of December 31, 2019.\n\n## ITEM 4.

        "text": "# Pricing \n\nWe price our products on either a per die or a per wafer basis, taking into account the complexity of the technology, the prevailing market conditions, the order size, the cycle time, the strength and history of our relationship with the customer and our capacity utilization. Because semiconductor wafer prices tend to fluctuate frequently, we in general review our pricing on a quarterly basis. As a majority of our costs and expenses are fixed or semi-fixed in nature, fluctuations in our products' average selling price historically have had a substantial impact on our margins. Our average selling price decreased by approximately $3.4 \\%$ from 2017 to 2018 , and further decreased by $2.9 \\%$ in 2019 , reflecting the continuing nominal price erosion in 2018 and 2019.\n\nWe believe that our current level of pricing is comparable to that of other leading foundries in each respective geometry. We believe that our ability to provide a wide range of advanced foundry services and process technologies as well as large manufacturing capacity will enable us to compete effectively with other leading foundries at a comparable price level.\n\n## Capacity Utilization Rates\n\nOur operating results are characterized by relatively high fixed costs. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, approximately $69.0 \\%, 68.6 \\%$ and $67.5 \\%$, respectively, of our manufacturing costs consisted of depreciation, a portion of indirect material costs, amortization of license fees and indirect labor costs.\n\nIf our utilization rates increase, our costs would be allocated over a larger number of units, which generally leads to lower unit costs. As a result, our capacity utilization rates can significantly affect our margins. Our utilization rates have varied from period to period to reflect our production capacity and market demand. Our average capacity utilization rate was $94.4 \\%, 93.1 \\%$ and $88.7 \\%$ for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Utilization rates were primarily affected by global macroeconomic factors. Other factors affecting utilization rates are efficiency in production facilities, product flow management, the complexity and mix of the wafers produced, overall industry conditions, the level of customer orders, mechanical failure, disruption of operations due to expansion of operations, relocation of equipment or disruption of power supply and fire or natural disaster.\n\nOur production capacity is determined based on the capacity ratings of the equipment in the fab, provided by the engineers, adjusted for, among other factors, actual output during uninterrupted trial runs, expected down time due to set up for production runs and maintenance, expected product mix and research and development. Because these factors include subjective elements, our measurement of capacity utilization rates may not be comparable to those of our competitors.\n\n## Change in Product Mix and Technology Migration\n\nBecause the price of wafers processed with different technologies varies significantly, the mix of wafers that we produce is among the primary factors that affect our revenues and profitability. The value of a wafer is determined principally by the complexity and performance of the processing technology used to produce the wafer, as well as by the yield and defect density. Production of devices with higher levels of functionality and performance, with better yields and lower defect density as well as with greater system-level integration requires better manufacturing expertise and generally commands higher wafer prices. The increase in price generally has more than offset associated increases in production cost once an appropriate economy of scale is reached.\n\nPrices for wafers of a given level of technology generally decline over the processing technology life cycle. As a result, we have continuously been migrating to increasingly sophisticated technologies to maintain the same level of profitability. We began our volume production with 65 -nanometer and 40 -nanometer technologies in 2006 and 2009, respectively. We introduced our 28 -nanometer technology to customers in 2011 and started large-scale commercial production in 2014. Our 28 nm and below technologies contributed approximately $17.1 \\%, 15.2 \\%$ and $11.3 \\%$ of our foundry revenue in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively."

        "text": "In accordance with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company has adopted the accounting policy that interest and penalties recognized are classified as part of its income taxes. The following shows the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n\n|   | 2019 |  | 2018 |  | 2017 |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of the year | \\$ | 6,029 | \\$ | 3,004 | \\$ | 2,460  |\n|  Increases related to prior year tax positions |  |  |  | 1,050 |  |   |\n|  Decreases related to prior year tax positions |  | (48) |  |  |  | (3)  |\n|  Increases related to current year tax positions |  | 2,064 |  | 1,075 |  | 547  |\n|  Unrecognized tax benefits, end of year | \\$ | 8,965 | \\$ | 6,029 | \\$ | 3,004  |\n\nThe Company does not anticipate that its total unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change due to settlement of examination or the expiration of statute of limitations during the next 12 months. The Company files U.S. and foreign income tax returns with varying statutes of limitations. Due to the Company's net carry-over of unused operating losses and tax credits, all years from 2003 forward remain subject to future examination by tax authorities.\n\n# Note 13. Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share\n\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less the weighted-average unvested common stock subject to repurchase or forfeiture as they are not deemed to be issued for accounting purposes. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, stock options, restricted stock units, ESPP, and convertible senior notes, to the extent dilutive. For the periods presented, all such common stock equivalents have been excluded from diluted net loss per share as the effect to net loss per share would be anti-dilutive.\n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of the Company's basic and diluted net loss per share during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except per share data):\n\n|   | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Numerator | 2019 |  | 2018 |   |\n|  Net loss | \\$ | $(53,607)$ | \\$ | $(26,203)$  |\n|  Denominator |  |  |  |   |\n|  Weighted-average common shares for basic and diluted net loss per share |  | 83,130 |  | 79,500  |\n|  Basic and diluted net loss per share | \\$ | $(0.64)$ | \\$ | $(0.33)$  |\n\nThe following table summarizes the potentially dilutive common shares that were excluded from diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect (in thousands):\n\n|   | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | 2019 |  | 2018 |   |\n|  Shares of common stock issuable under equity incentive plans outstanding |  | 6,832 |  | 8,943  |\n|  Convertible senior notes |  | 1,905 |  | 79  |\n|  Potential common shares excluded from diluted net loss per share |  | 8,737 |  | 9,022  |\n\nSince the Company expects to settle the principal amount of its outstanding convertible senior notes in cash and any excess in cash or shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $\\$ 81.45$ per share for the Notes."

        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nFor fiscal 2017, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences.\n\nAlthough the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur in the range of zero to $0.1 million of tax and zero to $0.2 million of interest based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time.\n\nBecause of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated prior to Tax Act reform depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOverview\n\nOur operating cash requirements consist primarily of working capital needs, operating expenses, capital expenditures, and payments of principal and interest on indebtedness outstanding, which primarily consists of lease and rental obligations at March 31, 2019. We believe that cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand of $40.8 million as of March 31, 2019, and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to meet our short-and long-term liquidity requirements.\n\nAs of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, our total debt was approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, comprised of capital lease obligations in both periods.\n\nAt March 31, 2019, 100% of our cash and cash equivalents, of which 94% is located in the United States, were deposited in bank accounts or invested in highly liquid investments with original maturity from date of acquisition of three months or less, including investments in commercial paper. Therefore, we believe that credit risk is limited with respect to our cash and cash equivalents balances.\n\nCash Flow\n\n|  (In thousands) | Year ended March 31, 2019 | 2018 | 2017  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Net cash provided by (used in): |  |  |   |\n|  Operating activities | $ 7,241 | $ 6,874 | $ 3,433  |\n|  Investing activities | (5,534) | (15,085) | (13,865)  |\n|  Financing activities | (767) | (1,295) | (847)  |\n|  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash | (112) | 194 | (74)  |\n|  Cash flows provided by (used in) operations | $ 828 | $ (9,312) | $ (11,353)  |\n\nCash flow provided by operating activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $7.2 million in fiscal 2019. The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $13.2 million adjusted for $22.4 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share based compensation and an increase of approximately $2 million in net operating assets and liabilities.\n\nCash flows provided by operating activities were $6.9 million in fiscal 2018. The provision of cash was due primarily to our operating loss of $12.1 million adjusted for $19.2 million in non-cash expense including depreciation, amortization, and share based compensation.\n\nCash flows provided by operating activities were $3.4 million in fiscal 2017. The provision of cash included $6.4 million in increased collections on accounts receivable.\n\nCash flow used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 were $5.5 million. This is primarily attributed to $2.2 million in development of proprietary software and $3.3 million for purchase of property and equipment, including internal use software.\n\n28"

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there was $\\$ 306,355$ and $\\$ 227,523$, respectively, of remaining unamortized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and RSUs granted to the Company's employees. This cost will be recognized over an estimated weighted-average remaining period of 2.03 years. Total unamortized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation Expense\n\nAll share-based awards are measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss over the period during which the employee is required to perform services in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period of the award).\n\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which requires assumptions, including the fair value of the Company's underlying common stock, expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield of the Company's common stock. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\n\nThese assumptions are estimated as follows:\n\n- Fair Value of Common Stock. The Company uses the five-day volume weighted average price for its common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.\n- Expected Term. The Company determines the expected term based on the average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The Company bases the expected term assumptions on its historical behavior combined with estimates of the post-vesting holding period.\n- Expected Volatility. The Company determines the price volatility factor based on the Company's historical volatility over the expected life of the stock options.\n- Risk-Free Interest Rate. The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation model on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term of the stock options for each stock option group.\n- Expected Dividend. The Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model.\n\nThe grant weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees were as follows:\n\n|   | Years ended |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | December 31, 2019 | December 31, 2018  |\n|  Expected volatility | $50.7 \\%$ | $54.2 \\%$  |\n|  Risk-free interest rate | $2.25 \\%$ | $2.72 \\%$  |\n|  Dividend yield | Nil | Nil  |\n|  Average expected life | 4.77 | 5.31  |"

Total bookings represents cash receipts from the sale of products to customers in a given period adjusted for products where we recognize revenue on a net basis and without giving effect to certain adjustments, primarily net refunds granted in the period. Total bookings provides valuable insight into the sales of our products and the performance of our business since we typically collect payment at the time of sale and recognize revenue ratably over the term of our customer contracts. We report total bookings without giving effect to refunds granted in the period because refunds often occur in periods different from the period of sale for reasons unrelated to the marketing efforts leading to the initial sale. Accordingly, by excluding net refunds, we believe total bookings reflect the effectiveness of our sales efforts in a given period.\n\n*Total customers*. We define a customer as an individual or entity, as of the end of a period, having an account with one or more paid product subscriptions. A single user may be counted as a customer more than once if the user maintains paid subscriptions in multiple accounts. Total customers is one way we measure the scale of our business and is an important part of our ability to increase our revenue base.\n\n*Average revenue per user (ARPU)*. We calculate ARPU as total revenue during the preceding 12 month period divided by the average of the number of total customers at the beginning and end of the period. ARPU provides insight into our ability to sell additional products to customers, though the impact to date has been muted due to our continued growth in total customers."

The effective income tax rate was 1.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a benefit of 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the income tax expense related primarily to foreign tax jurisdictions. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was due primarily to the determination that indefinite lived goodwill would provide a source of income to realize indefinite lived deferred tax assets, resulting in a tax benefit of $0.9 million.\n\nWe have assessed our ability to realize our deferred tax assets and have recorded a valuation allowance against such assets to the extent that, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, we placed significant weight on our history of generating U.S. tax losses, including in 2019. As a result, we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credits related primarily to research and development. We expect to maintain a full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\n\n# *Revenue*\n\n|   | For the Year Ended December 31, |  | Change |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | 2018 | 2017 | Amount | Percentage  |\n|   | (dollars in thousands) |  |  |   |\n|  Revenue: |  |  |  |   |\n|  Subscription and returns | $254,056 | $199,942 | $54,114 | 27%  |\n|  Professional services | 18,042 | 13,217 | 4,825 | 37%  |\n|  Total revenue | $272,098 | $213,159 | $58,939 | 28%  |\n\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $58.9 million, or 28%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

Growth in total revenue was due primarily to increased demand for our products and services from both new and existing customers. Of the increase in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, approximately $29.6 million was attributable to existing customers, approximately $28.3 million was attributable to new customers, and approximately $1.1 million was due to interest income on funds held for customers.

Our growth rate can depend on a variety of factors, such as new customers, the size, volume, and complexity of our agreements with our customers, foreign currency movements, our ability to work with our customers to implement and deliver our products, our ability to upsell and renew our existing customers, the success of our alliance and partnership arrangements, and the expansion of our business through emerging markets. The decline in the growth rate of total revenue was driven by our strategic plan to transition away from one-time professional services and recommit our efforts to grow recurring revenue and free cash flows.\n\nThe following table sets forth our sources of revenue for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except for percentages):\n\n|   | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |   |\n|  Subscription revenue | \\$ | 542,968 | \\$ | 473,052  |\n|  Percentage of subscription revenue to total revenue |  | 94.2\\% |  | 87.9\\%  |\n|  Professional services revenue | \\$ | 33,555 | \\$ | 64,839  |\n|  Percentage of professional services to total revenue |  | 5.8\\% |  | 12.1\\%  |\n|  Total revenue | \\$ | 576,523 | \\$ | 537,891  |\n\nSubscription revenue increased by $\\$ 69.9$ million, or $15 \\%$, in 2019 when compared to 2018.

        "text": "# 12. Employee Benefit Plans \n\n## ACI 401(k) Plan\n\nThe ACI 401(k) Plan is a defined contribution plan covering all domestic employees of the Company. Participants may contribute up to $75 \\%$ of their annual eligible compensation up to a maximum of $\\$ 19,000$ (for employees who are under the age of 50 on December 31, 2019) or a maximum of $\\$ 25,000$ (for employees aged 50 or older on December 31, 2019). After one year of service, the Company matches $100 \\%$ of the first $4 \\%$ of eligible participant contributions and $50 \\%$ of the next $4 \\%$ of eligible participant contributions, not to exceed $\\$ 5,000$ per employee annually. Company contributions charged to expense were $\\$ 6.4$ million during both the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and $\\$ 5.3$ million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\n## ACI Worldwide EMEA Group Personal Pension Scheme\n\nThe ACI Worldwide EMEA Group Personal Pension Scheme is a defined contribution plan covering substantially all ACI Worldwide (EMEA) Limited (\"ACI-EMEA\") employees. For those ACI-EMEA employees who elect to participate in the plan, the Company contributes a minimum of $8.5 \\%$ of eligible compensation to the plan for employees employed at December 1, 2000 (up to a maximum of $15.5 \\%$ for employees aged over 55 years on December 1, 2000) or from $6 \\%$ to $10 \\%$ of eligible compensation for employees employed subsequent to December 1, 2000. ACI-EMEA contributions charged to expense were $\\$ 1.5$ million during the year ended December 31, 2019, and $\\$ 1.6$ million during both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\n\n## 13. Income Taxes\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") was signed into U.S. Law. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had completed its accounting for the tax effects related to the enactment of the Tax Act.\n\nThe Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from $35 \\%$ to $21 \\%$, effective January 1, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded a $\\$ 15.0$ million provisional tax charge. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company reduced the initial provisional tax charge by recording a $\\$ 4.9$ million benefit related to accelerated tax deductions claimed on the 2018 U.S. Federal Income Tax Return.\n\nThe Tax Act required U.S. companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted foreign earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a $\\$ 20.9$ million provisional tax charge based on post-1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. Upon further analysis, the Company reduced the initial provisional tax charge by recording an $\\$ 8.1$ million benefit during the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a $\\$ 15.5$ million valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset related to U.S. foreign tax credits based upon business conditions and tax laws in effect at that time.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, following the acquisition of Speedpay, the Company determined it will more likely than not be able to utilize foreign tax credits in future years due to additional income generated by Speedpay; therefore, the Company released the $\\$ 15.5$ million valuation allowance that had been established on this deferred tax asset.\n\nThe Tax Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has elected to account for GILTI in the year the tax is incurred.\n\nPrior to 2018, the Company considered all earnings in foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and accordingly, recorded no deferred income taxes related to unremitted earnings. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company considered only the earnings in its Indian subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. The earnings of all other foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. The Company is also permanently reinvested for outside book/tax basis differences related to foreign subsidiaries.\n\nFor financial reporting purposes, income before income taxes includes the following components (in thousands):\n\n|  | Years Ended December 31, |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |\n| United States | \\$ $(16,317)$ | \\$ 16,312 | \\$ $(42,863)$ |\n| Foreign | 88,527 | 75,487 | 86,435 |\n| Total | \\$ 72,210 | \\$ 91,799 | \\$ 43,572 |"

For fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recognized amortization expense of $\\$ 49.1$ million, $\\$ 34.9$ million, and $\\$ 33.6$ million, respectively. Based on amortizing assets recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 26, 2019, amortization expense is estimated to average $\\$ 58.3$ million for each of the next five years, with a high expense of $\\$ 59.9$ million in fiscal 2020 and decreasing to a low expense of $\\$ 54.2$ million in fiscal 2024 .\n\nDuring fiscal 2019, in conjunction with the divestiture of our Italian-based frozen pasta business, Gelit, we reclassified $\\$ 15.1$ million and $\\$ 1.7$ million of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, respectively, to noncurrent assets held for sale for periods prior to the divestiture.\n\nDuring fiscal 2019, as a result of our annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles, we recognized impairment charges of $\\$ 76.5$ million for our Chef Boyardee ${ }^{\\circledR}$ and Red Fork ${ }^{\\circledR}$ brands in our Grocery \\& Snacks segment. We also recognized impairment charges of $\\$ 13.1$ million for our Aylmer ${ }^{\\circledR}$ and Sundrop ${ }^{\\circledR}$ brands in our International segment.\n\nDuring fiscal 2018, as a result of our annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles, we recognized impairment charges of $\\$ 4.0$ million for our HK Anderson ${ }^{\\circledR}$, Red Fork $^{\\circledR}$, and Salpica ${ }^{\\circledR}$ brands in our Grocery \\& Snacks segment. We also recognized an impairment charge of $\\$ 0.8$ million for our Aylmer ${ }^{\\circledR}$ brand in our International segment.\n\nDuring fiscal 2017, we recorded goodwill impairment charges in our International reporting segment totaling $\\$ 198.9$ million, of which $\\$ 139.2$ million related to our Canadian reporting unit and $\\$ 59.7$ million related to our Mexican reporting unit. These impairment charges resulted from a change in reporting segments, which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 when we were required to determine new reporting units at a lower level, and from further deterioration in forecasted sales and profits during fiscal 2017, which were caused primarily by changes in foreign exchange rates."

This ASU aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information regarding leasing arrangements to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Specifically, the standard requires operating lease commitments to be recorded on the balance sheet as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, and the cost of those operating leases to be amortized on a straight-line basis. ASU No. 2016-02 will be effective for JHA's annual reporting period beginning July 1, 2019. The Company established a cross-functional team to implement this standard and evaluated arrangements that would be subject to the standard, implemented software to meet the reporting and disclosure requirements of the standard, and assessed the impact of the standard on its processes and internal controls. The Company will adopt the new standard using the optional transition method in ASU 2018-11. Under this method, the Company will not adjust its comparative period financial statements for the effects of the new standard or make the new, expanded required disclosures for periods prior to the effective date. The Company will recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment, as necessary, to the opening balance of retained earnings for fiscal 2020 in connection with the adoption of the standard.\n\nThe Company will take advantage of the transition package of practical expedients permitted within the new standard, which among other things, allows it to carryforward the historical lease classification. In addition, the Company will make an accounting policy election that will keep leases with an initial term of twelve months or less off of the balance sheet. The Company also elected the practical expedient not to separate the non-lease components of a contract from the lease component to which they relate.\n\nUpon adoption of the standard, the Company will record right-of-use assets of approximately $\\$ 70,000$ to $\\$ 73,000$ and lease obligations of approximately $\\$ 73,000$ to $\\$ 75,000$ on the Company's balance sheet as of July 1, 2019. Adoption of the standard is not expected to significantly impact the Company's net income and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's compliance with the financial covenants under its credit facility.\n\nIn August of 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles, Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), which broadens the scope of Subtopic 350-40 to include costs incurred to implement a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The costs are capitalized or expensed depending on the nature of the costs and the project stage during which they are incurred, consistent with costs for internal-use software. The amendments in this update can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The ASU will be effective for the Company on July 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the guidance will have on its financial statements.\n\n## NOTE 2. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nFor cash equivalents, amounts receivable or payable and short-term borrowings, fair values approximate carrying value, based on the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Company's estimates of the fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:\n\nLevel 1: inputs to the valuation are quoted prices in an active market for identical assets\nLevel 2: inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly\nLevel 3: valuation is based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and the Company's own estimates of assumptions that it believes market participants would use in pricing the asset"

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to $32.7 \\%$ in fiscal 2019 from $33.9 \\%$ in fiscal 2018.\n\nWe use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. Cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices which continue to fluctuate for many of the raw materials we use, including copper, gold, and silver. In fiscal 2019, we purchased approximately 172 million pounds of copper, 122,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.6 million troy ounces of silver.

See \"Non-GAAP Measures and Related Performance Measures\" for information about these measures, including how we calculate them.\n\n## Revenue\n\nConsolidated revenue increased by 5\\% in 2018, reflecting revenue growth of $7 \\%$ in Wireless and $1 \\%$ in both Cable and Media. Wireless revenue increased as a result of the increased mix of subscribers on higher-rate plans from our various brands and an increase in sales of higher-value devices. Cable revenue increased by $1 \\%$ as the increase in Internet revenue from the general movement of customers to higher speed and usage tiers of our Internet offerings was partially offset by the decrease in legacy Television subscribers and the impact of Phone pricing packages. Media revenue increased by $1 \\%$ as a result of higher revenue at the Toronto Blue Jays, including a distribution from Major League Baseball, and higher Sportsnet and other network subscription revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue.\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA increased in 2018 to \\$5,983 million, reflecting increases in Wireless, Cable, and Media. Wireless adjusted EBITDA increased 10\\% as a result of the strong flow-through of service revenue growth, partially offset by higher expenditures associated with increased subscriber volumes and costs of devices. Cable adjusted EBITDA increased by 3\\% in 2018 as a result of strong Internet revenue growth, the ongoing product mix shift to higher-margin Internet services, and various cost efficiency and productivity initiatives.

        "text": "# Short-term Investments \n\nCertificates of deposit held for investment with an original maturity greater than 90 days and less than one year are carried at cost and reported as Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The certificates of deposit are not debt securities.\n\n## Concentrations of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Company currently invests its excess cash in government and prime money market funds. The cash in the Company's U.S. banks is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to the insurable limit of $\\$ 250,000$.\n\n## Income (Loss) per Share\n\nThe computation of basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share includes the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares had been issued. In periods with a net loss, all common stock equivalents are excluded from the per share calculation; therefore, the basic loss per share equals the diluted loss per share.\n\n## Inventories and Inventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market value. Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal. Should actual market conditions differ from the Company's estimates, the Company's future results of operations could be materially affected. Reductions in inventory valuation are included in Cost of revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand, product lifecycle status and product development plans. The Company uses historical information along with these future estimates to reduce the inventory cost basis. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Prices anticipated for future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values.\nThe components of inventories are as follows:\n\n|  | March 31, |  |  |\n| :-- | --: | --: | --: |\n| (in thousands) | 2019 | 2018 |  |\n| Raw materials | $\\$ 3,445$ | $\\$$ | 2,969 |\n| Finished goods | 6,356 |  | 6,253 |\n| Total inventories | $\\$ 9,801$ | $\\$$ | 9,222 |\n\n## Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets generally consist of prepaid product royalty, prepaid maintenance agreements and prepaid rent, which are amortized as expense generally over the term of the underlying contract or estimated product life.\n\n## Land, Property and Equipment\n\nLand, property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or for leasehold improvements, the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives for machinery and equipment range from 5 to 7 years and for office, computer and research equipment from 2 to 5 years. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment are capitalized.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $\\$ 0.6$ million and $\\$ 0.8$ million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360), the Company assesses all of its long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment when impairment indicators are identified. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss may be necessary. An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.\nThe Company acquired 16 acres of land with an acquisition and sold 4 acres in April 2015 for $\\$ 264,000$. The Company still owns 12 acres of land that remains on the market. The Company concluded that a sale transaction for the remaining land is not probable within the next year; therefore, unsold land is classified as held-and-used as of March 31, 2019 and 2018."

        "text": "The Registrant conducts its prepared chicken business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Foods Division), which has a facility in Flowood, Mississippi. This facility is engaged in the processing, marketing and distribution of approximately 130 processed and minimally prepared chicken items, which it sells nationally and regionally, principally to distributors and national food service accounts. The facility is managed by the same senior management team that manages our Processing Division.\n\n# Products \n\nThe Registrant has the ability to produce a wide range of processed chicken products and prepared chicken items.\nProcessed chicken is first salable as an ice-packed, whole chicken. The Registrant adds value to its ice-packed, whole chickens by removing the giblets, weighing, packaging and labeling the product to specific customer requirements and cutting and deboning the product based on customer specifications. The additional processing steps of giblet removal, close tolerance weighing and cutting increase the value of the product to the customer over whole, ice-packed chickens by reducing customer handling and cutting labor and capital costs, reducing the shrinkage associated with cutting, and ensuring consistently sized portions.\n\nThe Registrant adds additional value to the processed chicken by deep chilling and packaging whole chickens in bags or combinations of fresh chicken parts, including boneless product, in various sized, individual trays under the Registrant's brand name, which then may be weighed and pre-priced, based on each customer's needs. This chill-pack process increases the value of the product by extending shelf life, reducing customer weighing and packaging labor, and providing the customer with a wide variety of products with uniform, well designed packaging, all of which enhance the customer's ability to merchandise chicken products.\n\nTo satisfy some customers' merchandising needs, the Registrant freezes the chicken product, which adds value by meeting the customers' handling, storage, distribution and marketing needs and by permitting shipment of product overseas where transportation time may be as long as 60 days.\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the contribution, as a percentage of net sales dollars, of each of the Registrant's major product lines.\n\n|  | Fiscal Year Ended October 31, |  |  |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |\n| Registrant processed chicken: |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Value added: |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Fresh vacuum-sealed | $38.3 \\%$ | $35.2 \\%$ | $39.8 \\%$ | $37.6 \\%$ | $35.2 \\%$ |\n| Fresh chill-packed | 32.9 | 35.6 | 31.0 | 34.7 | 36.9 |\n| Fresh bulk-packed | 14.4 | 15.1 | 16.4 | 15.1 | 13.9 |\n| Frozen | 6.2 | 6.5 | 6.7 | 5.1 | 6.3 |\n| Subtotal | 91.8 | 92.4 | 93.9 | 92.5 | 92.3 |\n| Non-value added: |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Fresh ice-packed | 1.2 | 1.2 | 1.0 | 0.9 | 1.0 |\n| Subtotal | 1.2 | 1.2 | 1.0 | 0.9 | 1.0 |\n| Total Company processed chicken | 93.0 | 93.6 | 94.9 | 93.4 | 93.3 |\n| Minimally prepared chicken | 7.0 | 6.4 | 5.1 | 6.6 | 6.7 |\n| Total | $100.0 \\%$ | $100.0 \\%$ | $100.0 \\%$ | $100.0 \\%$ | $100.0 \\%$ |\n\n## Markets and Pricing\n\nThe three largest customer markets in the fresh and frozen chicken industry are food service customers that purchase fresh, bulk-packed products produced from a relatively big bird, retail grocery store customers that purchase fresh, traypacked products produced from a medium-sized bird, and quick-serve food service customers that purchase products produced from relatively small birds."

We have included these non-GAAP financial measures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because they are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Accordingly, we believe these measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. In addition, they provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as they remove the effect of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.\n\n- We exclude Starbucks transaction-based revenue and Starbucks transaction-based costs. As described above, Starbucks ceased using our payments solutions altogether, and we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of Starbucks is useful to investors.\n- We believe it is useful to exclude certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of intangible assets, and share-based compensation expenses, from our non-GAAP financial measures because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations."

The trading price of our ADSs may be affected by the trading price of our common shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the economic performance of Taiwan. The Taiwan Stock Exchange is smaller and, as a market, more volatile than the securities markets in the United States and some European countries. The Taiwan Stock Exchange has experienced substantial fluctuations in the prices and volumes of sales of listed securities, and there are currently limits on the range of daily price movements on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The Taiwan Stock Exchange is particularly volatile during times of political instability, such as when the relationship between Taiwan and the PRC becomes tense. Moreover, the Taiwan Stock Exchange has experienced disturbance caused by market manipulation, insider trading and payment defaults, and the government of Taiwan has from time to time intervened in the stock market by purchasing stocks listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The recurrence of these or similar events could deteriorate the price and liquidity of our common shares and ADSs.\n\nThe market price of the ADSs may also be affected by general trading activities on the U.S. stock exchanges, which recently have experienced significant volatility with respect to trading prices of technology companies. Fluctuation in interest rates and other general economic conditions may also influence the market price of the ADSs.\n\n## ITEM 4 INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\n\n## A. History and Development of the Company\n\nOur legal and commercial name is United Microelectronics Corporation, commonly known as \"UMC\". We were incorporated under the R.O.C. Company Law as a company limited by shares in May 1980 and our common shares were listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 1985. Our principal executive office is located at No. 3 Li-Hsin Road II, Hsinchu Science Park, Hsinchu, Taiwan, Republic of China, and our telephone number is 886-3-578-2258. Our Internet website address is www.umc.com. The information on our website does not form part of this annual report. Our ADSs have been listed on the NYSE under the symbol \"UMC\" since September 19, 2000. In 2019, we were ranked among the top $5 \\%$ of companies for a fifth consecutive year in the Corporate Governance Evaluation conducted by the Taiwan Stock Exchange and Taipei Exchange. The assessment was conducted across over 1,400 public companies in Taiwan.\n\nWe are one of the world's largest independent semiconductor foundries and a leader in semiconductor manufacturing process technologies. Our primary business is the manufacture, or \"fabrication\", of semiconductors, sometimes called \"chips\" or \"integrated circuits\", for others. Using our own proprietary processes and techniques, we make chips to the design specifications of our many customers. Our company maintains a diversified customer base across industries, including communication devices, consumer electronics, computer, and others, while continuing to focus on manufacturing for high growth, large volume applications, including networking, telecommunications, internet, multimedia, PCs and graphics. We sell and market mainly wafers which in turn are used in a number of different applications by our customers. The following table presented the percentages of our wafer sales by application for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n\n|  |  | Years Ended December 31, |  |  |\n| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |\n|  | Application | $\\mathbf{2 0 1 7}$ | $\\mathbf{2 0 1 8}$ | $\\mathbf{2 0 1 9}$ |\n|  |  | $\\%$ | $\\%$ | $\\%$ |\n| Communication |  | 48.6 | 45.2 | 52.2 |\n| Consumer |  | 29.4 | 28.6 | 26.4 |\n| Computer |  | 13.1 | 16.3 | 13.6 |\n| Others |  | 8.9 | 9.9 | 7.8 |\n| Total |  | $\\underline{100.0}$ | $\\underline{100.0}$ | $\\underline{100.0}$ |"

Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduced the United States statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (\u201cGILIT\u201d) tax and Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d) rules, respectively. In addition, in 2017 we were subject to a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to income tax in the United States. |  |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional expense of $15.3 million in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 in accordance with guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d), which allowed a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. This provisional benefit included $10.1 million expense for remeasurement of deferred tax balances to reflect the lower federal rate and expense of $5.2 million for the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to income tax in the United States. Adjustments to these provisional amounts that we recorded in 2018 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our accounting for the effects of the enactment of United States Tax Reform is now complete. Due to our divestiture of our investment in Netsmart, the amounts noted above do not include the provisional amounts recorded by Netsmart in 2017. |  |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  Our provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to valuation allowance, permanent differences, income attributable to foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates different from the United States federal statutory income tax rate, state taxes, tax credits and certain discrete items. Our effective tax rate decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with the prior year, primarily due to the effects of the stricter executive compensation deduction provisions of the Tax Act recorded in 2018, offset by the United States federal rate reduction of 21% versus 35% in 2017. |  |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income (loss). In the year ended December 31, 2018, we released $64.8 million of valuation allowance, mostly due to the utilization of capital loss carryforward against capital gain incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 and the utilization of federal credit carryforwards. |  |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  Discontinued Operations | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |  | 2019 % Change from 2018 | 2018 % Change from 2017  |\n|  (In thousands) | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |  |  |   |\n|  Loss from discontinued operations | $0 | $(72,836) | $(11,915) |  | (100.0%) | NM  |\n|  Gain on sale of Netsmart | 0 | 500,471 | 0 |  | (100.0%) | NM  |\n|  Income tax effect on discontinued operations | 0 | (32,497) | 42,263 |  | (100.0%) | (176.9%)  |\n|  Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax | $0 | $395,138 | $30,348 |  | (100.0%) | NM  |\n|  Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 |  |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  On December 31, 2018, we sold all of the Class A Common Units of Netsmart owned by the Company. Prior to the sale, Netsmart comprised a separate reportable segment, which due to its significance to our historical consolidated financial statements and results of operations, is now reported as a discontinued operation as a result of the sale for all periods presented. The loss from discontinued operations represents the net of losses incurred by Netsmart for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 partly offset by earnings attributable to two solutions acquired during the fourth quarter of 2017 as part of the EIS Business that we no longer support effective as of March 31, 2018.

See Note 1 and Note 14 for additional information on our lease accounting.\n(6) Accruals and other liabilities as of December 31, 2018 was adjusted to exclude the financial guarantee liability to conform to the current period presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 1 for additional discussion of our basis of presentation.\n\n## Note 10. Noncontrolling Interests\n\nGreenSky, Inc. is the sole managing member of GS Holdings and consolidates the financial results of GS Holdings. Therefore, the Company reports a noncontrolling interest based on the common units of GS Holdings held by the Continuing LLC Members. Changes in GreenSky, Inc.'s ownership interest in GS Holdings, while GreenSky, Inc. retains its controlling interest in GS Holdings, are accounted for as equity transactions. As such, future redemptions or direct exchanges of Holdco Units by the Continuing LLC Members (with automatic cancellation of an equal number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis will result in a change in ownership and reduce or increase the amount recorded as noncontrolling interest and increase or decrease additional paid-in capital. The Company consolidates the financial results of GS Holdings and reports a noncontrolling interest in its Consolidated Financial Statements representing the GS Holdings interests held by Continuing LLC Members. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, GreenSky, Inc. had a weighted average ownership interest in GS Holdings of $34.6 \\%$ and $31.2 \\%$, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the Reorganization Transactions and IPO, GreenSky, Inc. issued 129.0 million shares of Class B common stock to the Continuing LLC Members. Subsequent to the Reorganization Transactions and IPO during the year ended December 31, 2018, an aggregate of 0.3 million Holdco Units were exchanged by the Continuing LLC Members (with automatic cancellation of Class B common stock) for 0.3 million newly-issued shares of Class A common stock, increasing our total ownership interest in GS Holdings to $30.0 \\%$ as of December 31, 2018.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, GreenSky, Inc. had 66,424,838 and 54,504,902 shares, respectively, of Class A common stock outstanding, which resulted in an equivalent amount of ownership of Holdco Units. During the year ended December 31, 2019, an aggregate of 15.9 million Holdco Units were exchanged by the Continuing"

However, revenues for some of our products are quoted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and as such are directly affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar. As a result of currency variations, the appreciation of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar could increase our level of revenues when reported in U.S. dollars or the depreciation of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar could decrease our level of revenues when reported in U.S. dollars. Over time and depending on market conditions, the prices in the industry could align to the equivalent amount in U.S. dollars, except that there is a lag between the changes in the currency rate and the adjustment in the price paid in local currency, which is proportional to the amplitude of the currency swing, and such adjustment could be only partial and/or delayed, depending on market demand. Furthermore, certain significant costs incurred by us, such as manufacturing costs, SG\\&A expenses, and R\\&D expenses, are largely incurred in the currency of the jurisdictions in which our operations are located. Given that most of our operations are located in the Euro zone and other non-U.S. dollar currency areas, including Singapore, our costs tend to increase when translated into U.S. dollars when the U.S. dollar weakens or to decrease when the U.S. dollar strengthens."

These activities resulted in charges primarily for employee termination, other exit related costs associated with the write-off of property and equipment and inventory and early lease termination costs."

        "text": "Other intangibles include customer relationships, technology, trade names, trademarks and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets which have a finite useful life are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation of these intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives (three to fifteen years). The longest estimated useful life remaining at 31 March 2019 is five years.\n\nFor the year to 31 March 2019, the amortisation charge of $\u00a3 4.0 \\mathrm{~m}$ (2018: $\u00a3 4.1 \\mathrm{~m}$ ) has been charged to administrative expenses in the income statement. At 31 March 2019, \u00a30.1m (2018: \u00a30.1m) of software and website development costs represented assets under construction. Amortisation of these assets will commence when they are brought into use.\n\nIn accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, goodwill is not amortised, but instead is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\n# Impairment test for goodwill \n\nGoodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash-generating unit ('CGU') based on the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows independently in relation to the specific goodwill. The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined from value-in-use calculations that use cash flow projections from the latest three-year plan. The carrying value of CGUs is the sum of goodwill, property, plant and equipment and intangibles and is as follows:\n\n|  |  | (Restated) <br> 2019 <br> $\u00a3 \\mathrm{~m}$ |\n| :-- | --: | --: |\n| Digital | 327.6 | 342.6 |\n| Webzone | 6.6 | 6.9 |\n| Total | 334.2 | 349.5 |\n\nIncome and costs within the budget are derived on a detailed 'bottom up' basis - all income streams and cost lines are considered and appropriate growth, or decline, rates are assumed. Income and cost growth forecasts are risk adjusted to reflect specific risks facing each CGU and take into account the markets in which they operate. Key assumptions include revenue growth rates, associated levels of marketing support and directly associated overheads. All assumptions are based on past performance and management's expectation of market development. Cash flows beyond the budgeted period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rate stated into perpetuity which is consistent with industry reports. Other than as included in the financial budgets, it is assumed that there are no material adverse changes in legislation that would affect the forecast cash flows.\n\nThe pre-tax discount rate used within the recoverable amount calculations was $8.5 \\%$ (2018: $8.0 \\%$ ) and is based upon the weighted average cost of capital reflecting specific principal risks and uncertainties. The discount rate takes into account the risk-free rate of return, the market risk premium and beta factor reflecting the average beta for the Group and comparator companies which are used in deriving the cost of equity.\n\nThe same discount rate has been applied to both CGUs as the principal risks and uncertainties associated with the Group, as highlighted on pages 30 to 33, would also impact each CGU in a similar manner. The Board acknowledges that there are additional factors that could impact the risk profile of each CGU, which have been considered by way of sensitivity analysis performed as part of the annual impairment tests.\n\nKey drivers to future growth rates are dependent on the Group's ability to maintain and grow income streams whilst effectively managing operating costs. The level of headroom may change if different growth rate assumptions or a different pre-tax discount rate were used in the cash flow projections. Where the value-in-use calculations suggest an impairment, the Board would consider alternative use values prior to realising any impairment, being the fair value less costs to dispose.\n\nThe key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are as follows:\n\n|  | 2019 | 2018 |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| Annual growth rate (after plan period) | $\\mathbf{3 . 0 \\%}$ | $3.0 \\%$ |\n| Risk free rate of return | $\\mathbf{3 . 0 \\%}$ | $3.0 \\%$ |\n| Market risk premium | $\\mathbf{5 . 0 \\%}$ | $4.9 \\%$ |\n| Beta factor | $\\mathbf{0 . 8 3}$ | 0.79 |\n| Cost of debt | $\\mathbf{3 . 3 \\%}$ | $3.3 \\%$ |\n\nHaving completed the 2019 impairment review, no impairment has been recognised in relation to the CGUs (2018: no impairment). Sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing the recoverable amounts of goodwill. There are no changes to the key assumptions of growth rate or discount rate that are considered by the Directors to be reasonably possible, which give rise to an impairment of goodwill relating to the CGUs."

We discuss borrowings under \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below. Other income remained consistent and is comprised primarily of income resulting from the change in the fair value of earnout liabilities associated with prior business acquisitions. We estimate the fair value of earnout liabilities related to acquisitions quarterly.

        "text": "The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arm's-length pricing. The Global Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9 to 1 at December 31, 2019.\n\nAs previously stated, we measure Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing's external client and internal business is included in the \"Global Financing Results of Operations\" and in note D, \"Segments.\" In the Consolidated Income Statement, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing's internal financing to IBM is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.\n\n## Equity\n\nTotal equity increased by $\\$ 4,055$ million from December 31, 2018 as a result of net income of $\\$ 9,431$ million, a decline in accumulated other comprehensive losses of $\\$ 893$ million primarily due to retirement-related benefits plans, and an increase in common stock of $\\$ 745$ million; partially offset by decreases from dividends of $\\$ 5,707$ million, and an increase in treasury stock of $\\$ 1,342$ million mainly due to share repurchases.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nOur cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 71 are summarized in the table below.

The year-to-year increase in cash flow of $\\$ 19,512$ million was driven by:\n\n- An increase in net cash sourced from debt transactions of $\\$ 16,584$ million primarily driven by net issuances to fund the Red Hat acquisition; and\n- A decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases of $\\$ 3,082$ million.\n\nGlobal Financing Return on Equity Calculation\n(\\$ in millions)\n\n| At December 31: | 2019 | 2018 |\n| :-- | --: | --: |\n| Numerator |  |  |\n| Global Financing after-tax income ${ }^{(1) *}$ | $\\$ 765$ | $\\$ 1,065$ |\n| Denominator | $\\$ 2,968$ | $\\$ 3,460$ |\n| Average Global Financing equity ${ }^{(2) * *}$ | $25.8 \\%$ | $30.8 \\%$ |\n| Global Financing return on equity ${ }^{(12(2)}$ |  |  |\n\n* Calculated based upon an estimated tax rate principally based on Global Financing's geographic mix of earnings as IBM's provision for income taxes is determined on a consolidated basis.\n**Average of the ending equity for Global Financing for the last five quarters."

The Colombian Credit Facility may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, subject to certain limitations and prepayment consideration.\n\nThe South African Credit Facility, the Colombian Credit Facility and the Brazil Credit Facility are secured by, among other things, liens on towers owned by the applicable borrower.\n\nEach of the agreements governing the other subsidiary debt contains contractual covenants and other restrictions. Failure to comply with certain of the financial and operating covenants could constitute a default under the applicable debt agreement, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.\n\nShareholder Loan\u2014 On June 14, 2019, the Company purchased the remaining 294.4 million GHS ($56.8 million) of principal outstanding under the Ghana loan, plus unpaid interest. Amounts under the loan are now owed to one of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries and, as a result, are eliminated in consolidation as of the purchase date.\n\nFinance and Capital Lease Obligations\u2014The Company\u2019s finance and capital lease obligations approximated $30.7 million and $179.5 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The Tax Act contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate to $21.0 \\%$, implementing a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax assessment on previously tax-deferred foreign earnings and imposing new taxes on certain foreign-sourced income. We elected to pay the one-time transition tax over a period of up to eight years.\n\nIn conjunction with the Tax Act, the SEC issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") directing taxpayers to record the impact of the Tax Act as \"provisional\" when they do not have all the necessary information to complete the accounting under ASC 740. The guidance allowed for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impact. In accordance with SAB 118, we recorded provisional estimates to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2018 based on the Tax Act. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we further analyzed the income tax effects of the Tax Act and determined there were no material changes to the provisional amounts disclosed in our fiscal 2018 financial statements. Although our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act is complete under SAB 118, there may be future adjustments based on interpretations by the U.S. federal and state governments and regulatory organizations, legislative updates or new regulations, or changes in accounting standards for income taxes.\n\nThe Tax Act also includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. In general, this income will effectively be taxed at a $10.5 \\%$ tax rate reduced by any available current year foreign tax credits. This provision became effective for taxable years beginning"

Except as otherwise required by law or the Company's certificate of incorporation, holders of shares of the Company's capital stock vote as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, with each share of Common Stock entitled to one vote and each share of Class A Common Stock entitled to ten votes. Holders of capital stock have the right of cumulative voting in the election of directors. The Common Stock and Class A Common Stock have equal liquidation rights and the same dividend rights. In the case of any dividend payable in stock, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive the same percentage dividend (payable only in shares of Common Stock) as the holders of Class A Common Stock receive (payable only in shares of Class A Common Stock). Upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably with the holders of Class A Common Stock in all assets available for distribution after payment in full of creditors. The holders of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock are not entitled to preemptive or subscription rights. No class of capital stock may be combined or subdivided unless the other classes of capital stock are combined or subdivided in the same proportion. No dividend may be declared and paid on Class A Common Stock unless the dividend is payable only to the holders of Class A Common Stock and a dividend is declared and paid to Common Stock concurrently.\n\nEach share of Class A Common Stock is convertible, at the option of its holder, into one share of Common Stock at any time. The Company's Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation (\"Restated Charter\") identifies family members of Mr. Adams (\"Immediate Family Members\") and arrangements and entities that are permitted to receive and hold shares of Class A Common Stock, with ten votes per share, without such shares converting into shares of Common Stock, with one vote per share (\"Permitted Transferees\"). The Permitted Transferees include arrangements and entities such as revocable trusts and limited liability companies that could hold Class A Common Stock for the benefit of Immediate Family Members. Each Permitted Transferee must have a relationship, specifically defined in the Restated Charter, with another Permitted Transferee or an Immediate Family Member. A share of Class A Common Stock transferred to a person other than a Permitted Transferee would automatically convert into Common Stock with one vote per share. Additionally, the Restated Charter includes a sunset provision pursuant to which all of the outstanding Class A Common Stock will automatically convert to Common Stock if: (a) less than 4,300,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, in the aggregate, are beneficially owned by Immediate Family Members and/or Permitted Transferees, or (b) if less than 4,600,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, in the aggregate, are beneficially owned by Immediate Family Members and/or Permitted Transferees.\n\n## 14. Fair Value Measures\n\nThe Company is required to categorize both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable, and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.\n\n- Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n- Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n\nThe disclosure of fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at cost are as follows:\nCash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable: The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\n\nLong-term debt: The carrying value of the Company's long-term debt is at its stated value. We have not elected to carry our long-term debt at fair value. Fair values for debt are based on quoted market prices or published forward"

Share-based payments continued\n\nThe number of options outstanding and exercisable as at 31 March was as follows:\n\n|   | 2019\nNumber | 2018\nNumber  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Outstanding at 1 April | 303,880 | 248,263  |\n|  Options granted in the year | 71,552 | 127,691  |\n|  Dividend shares awarded | 3,343 | 1,306  |\n|  Options forfeited in the year | - | $(73,380)$  |\n|  Options exercised in the year | $(229,378)$ | -  |\n|  Outstanding at 31 March | 149,397 | 303,880  |\n|  Exercisable at 31 March | - | 74,686  |\n\nThe weighted average market value per ordinary share for DABP options exercised in 2019 was 438.1p (2018: n/a). The DABP awards outstanding at 31 March 2018 have a weighted average remaining vesting period of 0.8 years (2018: 1.2 years) and a weighted average contractual life of 8.8 years (2018: 9.2 years). The charge for the year includes an estimate of the awards to be granted after the balance sheet date in respect of achievement of 2019 targets.\n\n## Single Incentive Plan Award\n\nDuring the period, the Group introduced a new Single Incentive Plan Award ('SIPA') for the Operating Leadership Team and certain key employees. The scheme replaces the Performance Share Plan and the annual cash bonus scheme for all new awards for those individuals. The extent to which awards vest will depend upon the satisfaction of the Group's financial and operational performance in the financial year of the award date (the \"Performance Conditions\"). The awards will vest in tranches, with the first tranche vesting on the date on which the Remuneration Committee determines that the Performance Conditions have been satisfied, and subsequent tranches vesting on the first and second anniversary of this date, subject to continuing employment.\n\nOn 17 August 2018, the Group awarded 974,106 nil cost options under the SIPA scheme. For the 2018 awards, the Group's performance is measured by reference to Operating profit ( $75 \\%$ of the award), live car stock advertised on autotrader.co.uk ( $12.5 \\%$ of the award) and the average number of full page advert views ( $12.5 \\%$ of the award). The fair value of the 2018 award was determined to be $\u00a3 4.48$ per option using a Black-Scholes pricing model. The resulting share-based payments charge is being spread evenly over the period between the grant date and the vesting date. SIPA award holders are entitled to receive dividends accruing between the grant date and the vesting date and this value will be delivered in shares.\n\nThe assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the PSP awards are as follows:\n\n|  Grant date | Share price at grant date $\u00a3$ | Exercise price $\u00a3$ | Expected volatility \\% | Option life years | Risk-free rate \\% | Dividend yield \\% | Nonvesting condition \\% | Fair value per option $\u00a3$  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  17 August 2018 | 4.48 | Nil | n/a | 3.0 | 0.7 | 1.7 | 0.0 | 4.48  |\n\nExpected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the grant date. The number of options outstanding and exercisable as at 31 March was as follows:\n\n|   | 2019\nNumber | 2018\nNumber  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Outstanding at 1 April | - | -  |\n|  Options granted in the year | 974,106 | -  |\n|  Options forfeited in the year | $(51,054)$ | -  |\n|  Outstanding at 31 March | 923,052 | -  |\n|  Exercisable at 31 March | - | -  |"

Our total revenue growth was driven primarily by growth in our SaaS, software and hardware, and maintenance categories partially offset by decreases in our home health care services and sequencing and molecular analysis revenue categories.\n\nSaaS revenue was $\\$ 72.8$ million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $\\$ 7.2$ million, or $10.9 \\%$, from $\\$ 65.6$ million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This growth was due to a $\\$ 4.0$ million increase from Eviti platform solutions related to the combination of new customers and increased covered lives on existing customers and a $\\$ 3.2$ million increase in NaviNet SaaS revenue, largely from the higher value of professional services projects being completed in 2019.\n\nSoftware and hardware revenue increased $\\$ 3.5$ million, or $76.8 \\%$ from $\\$ 4.5$ million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to $\\$ 8.0$ million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The main contributing factor for this increase was the timing of a large DCX customer contract completed and recognized in the current year. Our software and hardware related revenue results experience fluctuations due to the timing of implementation completions for our DCX customers and our revenue recognition for those arrangements.\n\nMaintenance revenue increased $\\$ 0.7$ million, or $7.0 \\%$, from $\\$ 9.8$ million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to $\\$ 10.5$ million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was due to the timing of DCX customer contracts and post contract support maintenance services completed and recognized in the current year period.\n\nSequencing and molecular analysis revenue decreased $\\$ 1.4$ million, or $44.6 \\%$ from $\\$ 3.1$ million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $\\$ 1.7$ million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease reflected lower volume of GPS samples sequenced and recognized as revenue in the current year resulting from deliveries for patients covered by contract and non-contracted payers. Currently, we recognize revenue from clients with executed contracts, and from clients without a contractual agreement where we recognize revenue on a cash basis given the uncertainty over reimbursement. As we gain additional insurance coverage, including coverage under government insurance programs, we expect to be able to reduce the portion of sequencing and molecular analysis revenue which is recognized on a cash basis.\n\nWe continue to focus efforts to enhance reimbursement from plans when profiles are ordered and there is no payer contract in place. We are actively engaging plans with detail which supports a physician's reason for ordering. Our utilization of pre-authorizations and supporting documentation assists in the overall billing and appeal process, optimizing payment with payers, who do not have a formal agreement with us.\n\nIn parallel with the private payer activities described above, we are also making extensive efforts to explore approval pathways for our test capabilities (including the FDA in-vitro medical device clearance we received in November 2019), which we believe will facilitate coverage from governmental programs such as Medicare. Those activities are ongoing but have uncertainty on the timelines as to formal approval. Lastly, we have implemented an increase in the patient financial responsibility which is collected prior to testing to ensure that at least a partial payment is received for every test performed, we expect unpaid and partial paid orders to decline, which will likely result in a decline in total GPS orders and revenue in the short-term."

We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.\n\n### Financing Receivables and Guarantees\n\nThe following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions):\n\n|   | July 27, 2019 | July 28, 2018 | Increase (Decrease)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Lease receivables, net | $2,326 | $2,576 | (250)  |\n|  Loan receivables, net | 5,367 | 4,939 | 428  |\n|  Financed service contracts, net | 2,360 | 2,316 | 44  |\n|  **Total, net** | **$10,053** | **$9,831** | **$222**  |\n\n### Financing Receivables\n\nOur financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables increased by 2%. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.\n\n### Financing Guarantees\n\nIn the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms.\n\nThe volume of channel partner financing was $29.6 billion, $28.2 billion, and $27.0 billion in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion as of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 27, 2019, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $218 million, of which approximately $77 million was recorded as deferred revenue."

These liabilities were estimated using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of contingent consideration was determined based on a probability-based approach which includes projected results, percentage probability of occurrence and the application of a discount rate to present value the payments. A significant change in projected results, discount rate, or probabilities of occurrence could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. Changes in the fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities are reflected in operating expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations."

        "text": "# Other Legal Matters \n\nIn addition to the litigation described above, from time to time we are subject to or otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and legal proceedings that arise out of or are incidental to the conduct of our business (collectively, \"Legal Matters\"), including those relating to employment matters, patent rights, regulatory compliance matters, stockholder claims, and contractual and other commercial disputes. Such Legal Matters, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Additionally, an unfavorable outcome in a legal matter, including in a patent dispute, could require the Company to pay damages, entitle claimants to other relief, such as royalties, or could prevent the Company from selling some of its products in certain jurisdictions. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the results of the Legal Matters in which it is currently involved, the Company does not expect that the ultimate outcome of such Legal Matters will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## Investment Commitment\n\nWe have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $\\$ 7.9$ million in two private equity funds, of which $\\$ 7.7$ million has been applied to these commitments as of December 31, 2019.\n\n## Performance Bonds\n\nCertain contracts, customers and/or jurisdictions in which we do business require us to provide various guarantees of performance such as bid bonds, performance bonds and customs bonds. As of December 31, 2019, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling $\\$ 9.3$ million which expire at various dates through August 2024. As of December 31, 2018, we had commitments related to these bonds totaling $\\$ 6.5$ million. Although the triggering events vary from contract to contract, in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in our under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote.\n\n## Note 17 - Earnings (Loss) per Share\n\nA summary of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n\n| (In thousands, except for per share amounts) | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Numerator |  |  |  |\n| Net Income (Loss) | $\\$(52,982)$ | $\\$(19,342)$ | \\$23,840 |\n| Denominator |  |  |  |\n| Weighted average number of shares-basic | 47,836 | 47,880 | 48,153 |\n| Effect of dilutive securities: |  |  |  |\n| Stock options | - | - | 406 |\n| Restricted stock and restricted stock units | - | - | 140 |\n| Weighted average number of shares-diluted | 47,836 | 47,880 | 48,699 |\n| Earnings (loss) per share-basic | $\\$(1.11)$ | $\\$(0.40)$ | \\$0.50 |\n| Earnings (loss) per share-diluted | $\\$(1.11)$ | $\\$(0.40)$ | \\$0.49 |\n\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, 5.7 million and 2.5 million, respectively, shares of unvested stock options, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS due to their anti-dilutive effect.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, 3.2 million stock options were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares, therefore making them anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method."

        "text": "## Adjusted operating profit\n\nAdjusted operating profit increased by $\\$ 50.7$ million to $\\$ 109.0$ million in the period, resulting from strong revenue growth and benefiting from a small foreign exchange gain partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenditure. The reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to operating loss is included in note 5 of the Financial Statements.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nOperating profit was $\\$ 60.9$ million in the period, compared to a loss of $\\$ 19.7$ million in the comparative period which represents an improvement of $\\$ 80.6$ million. This was principally driven by strong growth in revenue, a foreign exchange gain in the period, compared to a loss in the comparative period, a decrease in the amortisation charge, and an exceptional credit compared to an exceptional loss in the comparative period. These gains were partially offset by an increase in overheads including Sales and Marketing costs.\n\n## Net finance costs\n\nNet finance costs decreased by $\\$ 14.0$ million to $\\$ 7.3$ million in the period, due mainly to foreign exchange gains on euro denominated debt following the strengthening of the US dollar in the period, resulting in a $\\$ 6.4$ million gain compared to a $\\$ 9.6$ million loss in the prior-year. Interest on uncertain tax positions increased by $\\$ 2.6$ million to $\\$ 3.5$ million due to the switch in the period of the overall tax balance from deferred tax to current tax, interest only being accrued on the latter balance.\n\n## Income tax\n\nThe Group's tax charge for the year was $\\$ 26.7$ million (FY18: $\\$ 19.9$ million) with an effective tax rate of 49.8 per cent (FY18: 48.5 per cent). The tax charge is higher than the prior-period primarily due to the Group generating a profit, compared with a loss in the comparative period.\n\n## Profit before tax and profit for the period\n\nThe profit before tax increased by $\\$ 94.6$ million to $\\$ 53.6$ million from a loss of $\\$ 41.0$ million in the prior-year, whilst the Group's profit for the year-ended 31 March 2019 increased by $\\$ 87.8$ million to $\\$ 26.9$ million from a loss of $\\$ 60.9$ million in the prior-year. This is as a result of strong revenue growth supported by increased Sales and Marketing spend and the benefit of a foreign exchange gain of $\\$ 1.5$ million, compared to a foreign exchange loss of $\\$ 6.9$ million in the prior-year combined with a slightly higher tax charge as explained above.\n\n## Cash flow\n\nNet cash flow from operating activities decreased by $\\$ 4.8$ million to $\\$ 142.9$ million from $\\$ 147.7$ million in the prior period. The small overall decrease was due to a $\\$ 9.9$ million reduction in the cashflow outflow on exceptional items, a $\\$ 7.0$ million improved use of working capital within the business, both being offset by an increase in overheads, primarily in relation to Sales and Marketing expenses.\n\nUnlevered free cashflow decreased by $\\$ 15.8$ million to $\\$ 123.8$ million from $\\$ 139.6$ million in the prior-period representing the reduction in net cash flow from operating activities adjusted for the cashflow impact of exceptional items.\n\n|  | FY19 | FY18 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Cash EBITDA ${ }^{2}$ | 167.9 | 199.2 |\n| Net deferral of revenue | (49.7) | (129.6) |\n| Net deferral of expenses | 0.9 | 8.4 |\n| Foreign exchange | 1.5 | (8.1) |\n| Depreciation | (11.6) | (11.6) |\n| Adjusted operating profit | 109.0 | 58.3 |\n| Net deferral of revenue | 49.7 | 129.6 |\n| Net deferral of expenses | (0.9) | (8.4) |\n| Exceptional items ${ }^{3}$ | (3.1) | (13.0) |\n| Depreciation | 11.6 | 11.6 |\n| Foreign exchange | (1.5) | 8.1 |\n| Change in working capital ${ }^{2}$ | (5.2) | (12.2) |\n| Corporation tax paid ${ }^{2}$ | (16.7) | (26.3) |\n| Net cash flow from operating activities | 142.9 | 147.7 |\n| Exceptional items ${ }^{3}$ | 3.1 | 13.0 |\n| Net capital expenditure ${ }^{2}$ | (22.2) | (21.1) |\n| Unlevered free cash flow | 123.8 | 139.6 |\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    1 Restated for the adoption of IFRS 15 and change in accounting policy in respect of research and development expenditure tax credit scheme (\"RDEC\") and provision for interest on uncertain tax positions, as explained in note 2 of the Financial Statements\n    2 Unlevered free cash flow is also represented by the sum of the marked rows and has been presented to enhance understanding of the Group's cash generation capability\n    3 Excludes non-cash movements on exceptional items"

Online games revenues grew by $10 \\%$ to RMB114.7 billion. The increase was primarily due to revenue contributions from domestic smart phone games including Honour of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite, as well as increased contributions from our overseas titles such as PUBG Mobile and Supercell titles, partly offset by the revenue decline from PC client games such as DnF. Social networks revenues increased by $17 \\%$ to RMB85,281 million. The increase mainly reflected revenue growth from digital content services such as live broadcast services and video streaming subscriptions.\n- Revenues from FinTech and Business Services increased by 39\\% year-on-year to RMB101.4 billion. The increase was primarily driven by greater revenues from commercial payment due to increased daily active consumers and number of transactions per user. Greater revenues from cloud services also contributed to the annual growth.\n- Revenues from Online Advertising business increased by 18\\% year-on-year to RMB68,377 million. Social and others advertising revenues grew by $33 \\%$ to RMB52,897 million. The increase mainly reflected higher advertising revenues derived from Weixin (primarily Weixin Moments and Mini Programs) as a result of its increased inventories and impressions, as well as contributions from our mobile advertising network due to increased traffic and video inventories. Media advertising revenues decreased by $15 \\%$ to RMB15,480 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising revenues from our media platforms including Tencent Video and Tencent News resulting from unpredictability in broadcast schedules and the challenging macro-environment, as well as the absence of the FIFA World Cup in year 2019."

        "text": "customer life as the option to renew without paying an upfront fee provides the customer with a material right. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company deferred and recognized revenues of $\\$ 397.5$ million and $\\$ 354.2$ million, respectively.\n\nA receivable is recognized in the period the Company provides goods or services when the Company's right to consideration is unconditional. Payment terms on invoiced amounts are generally 30 to 60 days.\n\n# Performance Obligations \n\nASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\"), requires that the Company disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price that is allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of December 31, 2019. The guidance provides certain practical expedients that limit this requirement. The service revenue contracts of the Company meet the following practical expedients provided by ASC 606:\n\n1. The performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.\n2. Revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer in accordance with ASC 606-10-55-18.\n\nThe Company has elected these practical expedients. Performance obligations related to our service revenue contracts are generally satisfied over time. For services transferred over time, revenue is recognized based on amounts invoiced to the customer as the Company has concluded that the invoice amount directly corresponds with the value of services provided to the customer. Management considers this a faithful depiction of the transfer of control as services are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer over the life of the contract. As such, revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations that will be billed in future periods has not been disclosed.\n\n## 3. EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nBasic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share (\"EPS\") are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating securities considering dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Certain of the Company's restricted stock awards are considered participating securities because holders are entitled to receive non-forfeitable dividends, if declared, during the vesting term.\n\nThe potentially dilutive impact of the Company's restricted stock awards is determined using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, if the average market price during the period exceeds the exercise price, these instruments are treated as if they had been exercised with the proceeds of exercise used to repurchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Any incremental difference between the assumed number of shares issued and repurchased is included in the diluted share computation.\n\nDiluted EPS includes securities that could potentially dilute basic EPS during a reporting period. Dilutive securities are not included in the computation of loss per share when a company reports a net loss from continuing operations as the impact would be anti-dilutive."

The acquired tenant-related intangibles typically represent the value to the Company of tenant contracts and relationships in place at the time of an acquisition or similar transaction, including assumptions regarding estimated renewals.The Company amortizes its acquired network location intangibles and tenant-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining weighted average amortization period of the Company\u2019s intangible assets was 15 years. Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $791.3 million, $1,144.1 million and $785.9 million, respectively. Amortization expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 because in 2018, the Company entered into agreements with one of its tenants in India, Tata Teleservices Limited (\u201cTata Teleservices\u201d) and related entities (collectively, \u201cTata\u201d), for a settlement and release of certain contractual lease obligations of Tata Teleservices. As a result, the Company recorded $327.5 million of accelerated amortization related to the Tata tenant relationship in 2018, which was subsequently retired.Based on current exchange rates, the Company expects to record amortization expense as follows over the next five years: | |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  Fiscal Year |  |  |  |  |  | Amount |   |\n|  2020 |  |  |  |  |  | $885.7 |   |\n|  2021 |  |  |  |  |  | 860.1 |   |\n|  2022 |  |  |  |  |  | 856.0 |   |\n|  2023 |  |  |  |  |  | 852.4 |   |\n|  2024 |  |  |  |  |  | 838.1 |   |\n|  6.

        "text": "# 28. Provisions continued \n\nThe lease provisions are for the continuing obligations under leases in respect of property dilapidation and reinstatement provisions. Where material, lease obligations are discounted. The Group expects these provisions to be utilised over one to ten years.\n\nOther provisions comprise environmental provisions related to property disposed of, provisions relating to legal claims and a provision relating to a Notice of Recovery received from French Customs, discussed below. The Group expects these provisions to be utilised in less than one year.\nIn 2018, the Group made a provision for $\\$ 8.9$ million following the receipt of a Notice of Recovery from the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Douanes et Droits Indirects (French Customs) in relation to the valuation and classification of duty on certain imports into France. This dispute commenced with enquiries in 2011. During the period in question, Spirent adopted a duty tariff based on World Customs Organization guidelines which conflicted with European Union regulation. In 2019, the Group paid $\\$ 6.5$ million in relation to this claim.\nThe import regulations changed on 1 January 2017 and no liability exists after that date. Spirent has provided for the liability up until the date of the change, which encompasses the period covered by the Notice of Recovery. The amount of the remaining provision includes uncertainties with regard not only to the legitimacy of the basis of the claim made by the French authorities, but also in relation to the period in question, the appropriate tariff classification, the recoverability of import VAT, and the population and valuation of goods potentially subject to duty.\nThe Group strongly refutes the basis of the claim paid under the Notice of Recovery and has reserved the right to challenge that basis in the courts at a future date.\n\n## 29. Contract balances\n\nThe following table provides information about receivables and contract liabilities from contracts with customers. The Group does not have any contract assets.\n\n|  |  | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |\n| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |\n| Trade receivables | 20 | $\\mathbf{1 2 8 . 7}$ | 123.4 | 113.8 |\n| Contract liabilities |  |  |  |  |\n| Payments received on account | 23 | $\\mathbf{2 . 3}$ | 1.0 | 3.8 |\n| Deferred income | 25 | $\\mathbf{6 6 . 8}$ | 69.6 | 72.7 |\n|  |  | $\\mathbf{6 9 . 1}$ | 70.6 | 76.5 |\n| Revenue recognised in the period from amounts included in contract liabilities at the |  |  |  |  |\n| beginning of the period |  | $\\mathbf{5 6 . 2}$ | 65.5 | 62.1 |\n\nThere was no revenue recognised in 2019, 2018 or 2017 from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods.\nThe timing of revenue recognition, invoicing and cash collections results in trade receivables, deferred income and advance customer payments received on account on the balance sheet.\n\nThe Group receives payments from customers based on a billing schedule, as established in the contract. Trade receivables are recognised when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue as (or when) the Group performs under the contract.\n\nThe Group also recognises incremental costs incurred to obtain a contract as an asset if it expects to recover those costs. Such costs are presented in the balance sheet as assets recognised from costs to obtain a contract and disclosed in note 21.\n\n## Expected realisation of remaining performance obligations at year end\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient in paragraph 121 of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.\n\nFor contracts that exceed one year, deferred income that relates to unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations at year end is expected to be recognised as revenue in the future as follows:\n\n|  | 2019 | 2018 |\n| :-- | --: | --: |\n| Within one year | $\\mathbf{1 8 . 3}$ | 15.5 |\n| Greater than one year | $\\mathbf{1 0 . 3}$ | 12.7 |\n|  | $\\mathbf{2 8 . 6}$ | 28.2 |\n\nThe above information represents the revenue the Group will recognise when it satisfies the remaining performance obligations in the contracts. The amounts presented do not include orders for which the Group has not performed."

In June 2019, one of our lightering customers, Philadelphia Energy Solutions (\"PES\"), suffered an explosion and fire at its refinery in the Delaware Bay. The refinery has been shut down since the fire. In July 2019, PES filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Due to the reduction in lightering volumes, we redeployed one of our two lightering ATBs to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for alternative employment.\n\n# RESULTS FROM VESSEL OPERATIONS \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, shipping revenues decreased by $\\$ 10,616$ or $2.9 \\%$ compared to 2018. The decrease primarily resulted from three fewer vessels in operation during most of 2019 compared to 2018 and one less Government of Israel voyage in 2019 compared to 2018.

TCE revenues, a non-GAAP measure, provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with shipping revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because it assists management in decisions regarding the deployment and use of our vessels and in evaluating their financial performance.\n\nThe following table provides a breakdown of TCE rates achieved for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 between spot and fixed earnings and the related revenue days.\n\n|  | 2019 |  | 2018 |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | Spot Earnings | Fixed Earnings | Spot Earnings | Fixed Earnings |\n| Jones Act Handysize Product Carriers: |  |  |  |  |\n| Average rate | \\$ 25,036 | \\$ 57,910 | \\$ 31,254 | \\$ 60,252 |\n| Revenue days | 523 | 4,052 | 1,142 | 3,141 |\n| Non-Jones Act Handysize Product Carriers: |  |  |  |  |\n| Average rate | \\$ 30,671 | \\$ 13,912 | \\$ 25,925 | \\$ 12,097 |\n| Revenue days | 482 | 417 | 707 | 3 |\n| ATBs: |  |  |  |  |\n| Average rate | \\$ 19,117 | \\$ 21,861 | \\$ 15,333 | \\$ 22,207 |\n| Revenue days | 255 | 773 | 990 | 998 |\n| Lightering: |  |  |  |  |\n| Average rate | \\$ 63,162 | \\$ \u2014 | \\$ 66,041 | \\$ \u2014 |\n| Revenue days | 713 | \u2014 | 697 | \u2014 |\n\nDuring 2019, TCE revenues increased by $\\$ 8,426$, or $2.6 \\%$, to $\\$ 335,133$ from $\\$ 326,707$ in 2018. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in average daily rates earned by our fleet and decreased spot market exposure. The total number of revenue days decreased from 7,678 days in 2018 to 7,215 days in 2019. The decrease primarily resulted from three fewer vessels in operation during most of 2019 compared to 2018.\n\nVessel expenses remained stable at $\\$ 134,618$ in 2019 from $\\$ 134,956$ in 2018. Depreciation expense increased by $\\$ 1,987$ to $\\$ 52,499$ in 2019 from $\\$ 50,512$ in 2018. The increase was due to an increase in amortization of drydock costs and an increase in depreciation expense due to the Overseas Gulf Coast and Overseas Sun Coast, our two new vessels, which entered service at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2019."

The amount will be paid on or around 30 September 2019 and is expected to be $\\$ 717$ million. As the dividend was declared subsequent to 30 June 2019, no provision had been made as at 30 June 2019.\n\n## Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP)\n\nThe DRP remains active. Eligible shareholders may participate in the DRP in respect of all or part of their shareholding. There is currently no DRP discount applied and no limit on the number of shares that can participate in the DRP.\nShares will be allocated to shareholders under the DRP for the 2019 final dividend at an amount equal to the average of the daily volume weighted average market price of ordinary shares of the Company traded on the ASX over the period of 10 trading days commencing on 6 September 2019. The last date for receipt of election notices for the DRP is 5 September 2019. The Company may acquire shares on-market during this period to satisfy its obligations under the DRP.\n\nDuring the period, 13.4\\% (2018: 39.9\\%) of the dividends paid were reinvested in shares of the Company. The change in the reinvestment participation rate reflects the removal of the discount with effect from the 2018 final dividend paid on 12 October 2018.

During 2019, we hired a chief commercial officer, a chief technology officer, five new salespeople, a human resources manager, as well as other administrative positions. We also added 14 employees as a result of our RMDY acquisition in October 2019. During 2018, we added to our staff in several key areas, including a head of data analytics, an additional VP of sales, and a controller. We also added 10 employees in late 2018 as a result of our CareSpeak acquisition. The full year impact of these 2018 hires also increased payroll expense in 2019. We expect our compensation expense to increase in 2020, but at a much lower rate than in 2019.\n\nProfessional fees increased primarily because of costs associated with our uplisting to Nasdaq and the completion of the underwritten offering, as well as ongoing compliance with Sarbanes Oxley. We also switched auditors in 2019, which resulted in higher audit fees.\n\nAcquisition costs are related to our acquisitions of RMDY Health in 2019 and CareSpeak Communications in October 2018. These costs include investment banker fees, legal and accounting due diligence, audit costs associated with CareSpeak, valuation experts for the purchase price allocation, and other miscellaneous costs. Since RMDY Health was a larger company than CareSpeak Communications, the costs associated with the acquisition were higher.\n\nBoard compensation decreased slightly from 2018 to 2019 as we had five independent directors for a portion of 2018, as opposed to the four that we had in 2019.\n\nThe cost of consultants increased from 2018 to 2019. The primary reason for the increase was related to consultants used for quality certifications, as well as for marketing activities.\n\nOur advertising and promotion costs increased significantly from 2018 to 2019 as a result of increased marketing activities. This included increased attendance and sponsorship at conferences, rebranding, and other marketing activities.\n\nExpenses related to research, development, management, and maintenance of our technology increased in 2019 primarily as a result of research into potential new product areas.\n\nIntegration incentives, which are fees paid to accelerate access to new partners, increased in 2019, as we launched with a greater number of new EHRs in 2019 than in 2018."

The Company uses a cost-based input measurement of progress because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer, which occurs as costs are incurred during the manufacturing process or as services are rendered. Under the cost-based measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the costs incurred to date.\n\nThere were no other costs to obtain or fulfill customer contracts.\n\n## Disaggregated Revenue\n\nThe table below includes the Company's revenue for the fiscal year endedSeptember 28, 2019 disaggregated by geographic reportable segment and market sector (in thousands):\n\n|   | Fiscal Year Ended September 28, 2019 |  |  |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |  | Reportable Segment: |  |  |   |\n|   | AMER | APAC | EMEA |  | Total  |\n|  Market Sector: |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  Healthcare/Life Sciences | \\$ | 488,851 | \\$ 602,922 | \\$ | 128,225  |\n|  Industrial/Commercial |  | 359,381 | 534,971 |  | 86,868  |\n|  Aerospace/Defense |  | 317,558 | 186,486 |  | 84,556  |\n|  Communications |  | 256,523 | 113,329 |  | 4,764  |\n|  External revenue |  | 1,422,313 | 1,437,708 |  | 304,413  |\n|  Inter-segment sales |  | 6,995 | 119,497 |  | 5,520  |\n|  Segment revenue | \\$ | 1,429,308 | \\$ 1,557,205 | \\$ | 309,933  |\n\nFor the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019, approximately $90 \\%$ of the Company's revenue was recognized as products and services were transferred over time, respectively.\n\n## Contract Balances\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, contract assets, and deferred revenue on the Company's accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nContract Assets: For performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, at which point the customer has been billed and the resulting asset is recorded within accounts receivable. For performance obligations satisfied over time as work progresses, the Company has an unconditional right to payment, which results in the recognition of contract assets.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued\n\n### April 30, 2019 and 2018\n\nThe components of deferred taxes are as follows (in thousands):\n\n|   | 2019 | 2018  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  **Deferred tax assets:** |  |   |\n|  Employee benefits | $5,092 | $5,078  |\n|  Inventory | 1,649 | 1,129  |\n|  Accounts receivable | 204 | 213  |\n|  Tax credits | 1,300 | 1,213  |\n|  Other assets | 148 | 139  |\n|  Capital Loss carry-forward | 2,455 | 1,385  |\n|  Net operating loss carry-forwards | 5,556 | 6,451  |\n|  **Total deferred tax asset** | 16,404 | 15,608  |\n|  **Deferred tax liabilities:** |  |   |\n|  Property, plant and equipment | (1,344) | (1,639)  |\n|  Other liabilities | (343) | (821)  |\n|  Deferred state income tax | (767) | (727)  |\n|  Net deferred tax asset | 13,950 | 12,421  |\n|  Valuation allowance | (13,950) | (12,688)  |\n|  **Net deferred tax liability** | - | (267)  |\n\nThe components of the deferred tax asset were as follows (in thousands):\n\n|   | 2019 | 2018  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Gross deferred assets | $13,950 | $12,421  |\n|  Valuation allowance | (13,950) | (12,688)  |\n|  Net deferred tax (liability) asset | - | (267)  |\n\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or net operating loss carry-forwards can be utilized. We assess all positive and negative evidence when determining the amount of the net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, prior earnings history, scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income. Significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable.\n\nAs required by the authoritative accounting guidance on accounting for income taxes, the Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets at each reporting date. Accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that the deferred tax assets are not more-likely-than-not realizable, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. As of April 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company had a full valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to reduce its existing valuation allowance resulting in less income tax expense. For the years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, the valuation allowance increased by approximately $1.3 million and $9.4 million, respectively.\n\nAs of April 30, 2019, the Company has U.S. federal net operating losses of $23 million of which $4 million begins to expire in Fiscal 2023 through 2031 and which are subject to annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. The remaining U.S. federal net operating losses of $18.9 million have an indefinite carry-forward period. The U.S. federal capital loss carry-forward of $9.9 million expires in 2023. The Company also has state net operating loss carry-forwards, R&D tax credits, and state tax credits that expire in various years and amounts."

        "text": "The fair value of the derivative feature of the 127,346 and 295,945 warrants issued to the placement agent of the Company's 2016 private offering and to a holder of its debt for debt cancellation in connection with the Merger, respectively on the issuance dates and at the balance sheet date were calculated using a Black-Scholes option model valued with the following assumptions:\n\n|   | December 31, 2018 | December 31, 2019  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Exercise price | 1.25 | 1.25  |\n|  Risk free interest rate | $2.46 \\%$ | $1.59 \\%$  |\n|  Dividend yield | $0.00 \\%$ | $0.00 \\%$  |\n|  Expected volatility | $152 \\%$ | $133 \\%$  |\n|  Contractual term | 2.15 Years | 1.15 Years  |\n\nRisk-free interest rate: The Company uses the risk-free interest rate of a U.S. Treasury Note with a similar expected term on the date of measurement. Dividend yield: The Company uses a $0 \\%$ expected dividend yield as the Company has not paid dividends to date and does not anticipate declaring dividends in the near future.\n\nVolatility: The Company calculates the expected volatility of the stock price based on the corresponding volatility of the Company's peer group stock price for a period consistent with the warrants' expected term.\n\nExpected term The Company's expected term is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the warrants. During the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company marked the derivative feature of the warrants to fair value and recorded a loss of $\\$ 343,857$ and a gain of $\\$ 250,241$ relating to the change in fair value, respectively.\n\n# Derivative Liability\n\nThe Company evaluates its options, warrants or other contracts, if any, to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC 815-10-05-4 and 815-40-25. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as either an asset or a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion, exercise or cancellation of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the date of conversion, exercise or cancellation and then the related fair value is reclassified to equity.\n\nThe classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Derivative instrument liabilities will be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company accounts for stock based compensation costs under the provisions of ASC 718, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation\", which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Stock based compensation expense recognized includes the compensation cost for all stock based payments granted to employees, officers, and directors based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718. ASC. 718 is also applied to awards modified, repurchased, or canceled during the periods reported.\n\nIf any award granted under the Company's 2016 Equity Compensation Plan (the \"2016 Plan\") payable in shares of common stock is forfeited, cancelled, or returned for failure to satisfy vesting requirements, otherwise terminates without payment being made, or if shares of common stock are withheld to cover withholding taxes on options or other awards, the number of shares of common stock as to which such option or award was forfeited, or which were withheld, will be available for future grants under the 2016 Plan. The Company recognizes the impact of forfeitures when they occur."

The component of unamortized net gains or losses related to our post-retirement life insurance plan is amortized based on the estimated remaining future service period of the plan participants (estimated to be approximately 4 years at December 31, 2019). The Company uses a market-related approach to value plan assets, reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five-year period. The variance resulting from the difference between the expected and actual return on plan assets is included in the amortization calculation upon reflection in the market-related value of plan assets. |  |   |\n|  In 2020, we expect to recognize approximately $6,429 of pre-tax losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our pension plans and post-retirement life insurance plan, respectively. |  |   |\n|  The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for those Pension Plans with accumulated benefit obligation in excess of fair value of plan assets is shown below: |  |   |"

As a result of the modification, 0.8 million awards vested during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which resulted in approximately $\\$ 24.9$ million of stock-based compensation expense recognized.\n\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock units activity from August 31, 2018 through August 31, 2019:\n\n|  | Shares | Weighted- <br> Average <br> Grant-Date <br> Fair Value |\n| :-- | --: | --: |\n| Outstanding as of August 31, 2018 | $8,352,307$ | $\\$ 24.34$ |\n| Changes during the period |  |  |\n| Shares granted $^{(1)}$ | $3,144,205$ | $\\$ 25.25$ |\n| Shares vested | $(1,983,411)$ | $\\$ 25.07$ |\n| Shares forfeited | $(2,347,628)$ | $\\$ 24.78$ |\n| Outstanding as of August 31, 2019 | $7,165,473$ | $\\$ 26.27$ |\n\n(1) For those shares granted that are based on the achievement of certain performance criteria, the amount represents the maximum number of shares that can vest. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019, the Company awarded approximately 1.6 million time-based restricted stock units, 0.4 million performancebased restricted stock units and 0.4 million market-based restricted stock units based on target performance criteria.\n\nThe following table represents the restricted stock units and SARS stock-based compensation information for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n|  | Fiscal Year Ended August 31, |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |\n| Intrinsic value of SARS exercised | \\$ 335 | \\$ 909 | \\$ 5,053 |\n| Fair value of restricted stock units vested | \\$ 49,725 | \\$62,592 | \\$44,010 |\n| Tax benefit for stock compensation expense ${ }^{(1)}$ | \\$ 611 | \\$ 1,122 | \\$ 560 |\n| Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense - restricted stock units | \\$ 41,778 |  |  |\n| Remaining weighted-average period for restricted stock units expense | 1.3 years |  |  |\n\n(1) Classified as income tax expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations."

Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the 2016 Plan, for awards to employees, no performance-based restricted shares or restricted share units shall be based on a restriction period of less than one year, and any time-based restricted shares or restricted share units shall have a minimum restriction period of three years.\n\nWe record compensation expense related to stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, and performance shares granted to certain employees and non-employee directors based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. The fair value of restricted share and performance share awards is based on the closing price of our common shares on the grant date. The fair value of stock option and stock-settled appreciation right awards is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, life of the award, and the volatility of our common shares.\n\nThe following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for options, SSARs, restricted and performance awards included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\n|  (In thousands) | Year ended March 31, |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | 2019 | 2018 | 2017  |\n|  Product development | \\$ 1,478 | \\$ 1,306 | \\$ 1,545  |\n|  Sales and marketing | 469 | 371 | 360  |\n|  General and administrative | 2,429 | 3,011 | 522  |\n|  Total share-based compensation expense | \\$ 4,376 | \\$ 4,688 | \\$ 2,427  |\n\n# Stock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights\n\nStock-Settled Appreciation Rights (\"SSARs\") are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference in the price of our common shares on the date of the grant and on the date of exercise. This value is settled only in common shares of Agilysys.\n\nWe use a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of SSARs. The following table summarizes the principal assumptions utilized in valuing SSARs granted in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017:\n\n|   | 2019 | 2018 | 2017  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Risk-free interest rate | $\\mathbf{2 . 6 8 \\%}$ | $1.74 \\%-1.94 \\%$ | $0.94 \\%-2.14 \\%$  |\n|  Expected life (in years) | 5 | 5 | 5  |\n|  Expected volatility | $\\mathbf{3 2 . 4 2 \\%}$ | $32.42 \\%-32.84 \\%$ | $35.25 \\%-40.22 \\%$  |\n|  Weighted average grant date fair value | $\\mathbf{\\$ 4 . 7 2}$ | $\\$ 3.36$ | $\\$ 3.69$  |\n\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury bond whose maturity period approximates the expected life of the SSARs. The expected life is estimated using historical data representing the period of time the awards are expected to be outstanding. The estimated fair value of the SSARs granted is recognized over the vesting period of the awards utilizing the graded vesting method. Under this method, the compensation cost related to unvested amounts begins to be recognized as of the grant date.\n\nThe following table summarizes the activity during fiscal 2019 for SSARs awarded under the 2016 and 2011 Plans:\n\n|  (In thousands, except share and per share data) | Number of Rights | WeightedAverage Exercise Price | Remaining Contractual Term | Aggregate Intrinsic Value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |  | (per right) | (in years) |   |\n|  Outstanding at April 1, 2018 | 1,103,160 | \\$ 10.60 |  |   |\n|  Granted | 158,244 | 14.22 |  |   |\n|  Exercised | $(193,819)$ | 10.20 |  |   |\n|  Forfeited | $(44,804)$ | 10.91 |  |   |\n|  Cancelled/expired | $(6,138)$ | 10.62 |  |   |\n|  Outstanding at March 31, 2019 | 1,016,643 | \\$ 11.22 | 4.8 | \\$ 7,251  |\n|  Exercisable at March 31, 2019 | 707,950 | \\$ 10.93 | 4.5 | \\$ 7,251  |\n|  Vested and expected to vest at March 31, 2019 | 1,016,643 | \\$ 11.22 | 4.5 | \\$ 10,111  |"

The Group anticipates that a number of tax audits are likely to conclude in the next 12 to 24 months. Due to the uncertainty associated with such tax items, it is possible at a future date, on the conclusion of open tax matters, the final outcome may vary significantly.\n\nThe change in tax rate during the year occurs in respect of the re-measurement of a deferred tax asset due to the future reduction of the UK tax rate.\n\n## Expected Future Rate\n\nOver the medium-term the tax rate is likely to stabilise as the integration of acquisitions in higher rate jurisdictions are completed. However, the tax rate may fluctuate if business changes are implemented in response to legislation arising from the OECD's Base Erosion \\& Profit Shifting Project. Legislative change in key territories is being monitored and acted upon.\n\nThe Group does not anticipate any significant impact on the future tax charge, liabilities or assets, as a result of the triggering of Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union, but cannot rule out the possibility that, for example, a failure to reach satisfactory arrangements for the UK's future relationship with the European Union, could have an impact on such matters.\n\nThe European Commission has concluded its investigation into the UK's controlled foreign company (\"CFC\") rules. The CFC rules levy a charge on foreign entities controlled by the UK that are subject to a lower rate of tax, however there is currently an exemption available for $75 \\%$ of this charge if the activities being undertaken by the CFC relate to financing. The EC concluded that this exemption is in breach of EU State Aid rules. However, whilst we are awaiting further detail from HMRC, the position has not changed from a tax accounting perspective. The risk is possible, but not probable. UK ministers have yet to decide on whether to pursue an appeal. No provision for this potential liability of $\\$ 3.6 \\mathrm{M}$ has been provided in these Consolidated Financial Statements as it is not clear what, if any, the ultimate financial result will be.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following:\n\n|  | 31 March 2019 | 31 March 2018 <br> Restated <br> See note 2 |\n| :-- | --: | --: |\n| Deferred income tax assets in relation to: | $\\$ M$ |  |\n| Deferred revenue | 40.9 | 40.0 |\n| Tax value of carry forward losses of UK subsidiaries | 37.0 | 24.2 |\n| Tax value of carry forward losses of overseas subsidiaries | 6.2 | 6.4 |\n| Advanced capital allowances | 7.5 | 7.7 |\n| Share-based payments | 11.6 | 27.7 |\n| Other temporary differences | 11.8 | 14.7 |\n| Total | 115.0 | 120.7 |\n| Deferred income tax liabilities in relation to: |  |  |\n| Intangible assets | 6.1 | 5.9 |\n| Deferred selling cost | 8.5 | 8.5 |\n| Other temporary differences | - | 0.1 |\n| Total | 14.6 | 14.5 |"

        "text": "# New Accounting Standards\n\n## Leases\n\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification 842 \"Leases\" (\"ASC 842\") using the modified retrospective method, reflecting any cumulative effect as an adjustment to equity. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historical accounting under ASC 840 \"Leases.\"\n\nThe Company elected the permitted practical expedients not to reassess the following related to leases that commenced before the effective date of ASC 842: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases; (ii) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) initial direct costs for any existing leases. Upon adoption, the Company recorded right of use assets of $\\$ 41.8$ million and lease liabilities of $\\$ 54.2$ million. The difference between the value of the right of use assets and lease liabilities is due to the reclassification of existing deferred rent, prepaid rent, and unamortized lease incentives as of January 1, 2019. See \"Note 9. Leases\" for additional information.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\" which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of \"other-than-temporary\" impairments. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\n\n## 3. MARKETABLE SECURITIES\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company did not hold any marketable securities.\n\n|   | December 31, 2018 |  |  |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  (in thousands) | Amortized Cost | Unrealized Gains |  | Unrealized Losses | Fair Value  |\n|  Municipal bonds | \\$ 44,802 | \\$ 13 | \\$ | (110) | \\$ 44,705  |\n|  Corporate bonds | 48,499 | 23 |  | (226) | 48,296  |\n|   | \\$ 93,301 | \\$ 36 | \\$ | (336) | \\$ 93,001  |\n\n## 4.

        "text": "# Foodservice \n\nThe Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, sauces, and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products, that are packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments primarily in the United States.\n\n## Pinnacle Foods\n\nThe Pinnacle Foods reporting segment includes branded and private-labeled food products, in various temperature states, sold in various retail and foodservice channels in the United States and Canada. Results of the Pinnacle Foods segment reflect activity beginning on October 26, 2018, the date of the Pinnacle acquisition.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe Commercial reporting segment included commercially branded and private label food and ingredients, which were sold primarily to commercial, restaurant, foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The segment's primary food items included a variety of vegetable, spice, and frozen bakery goods, which were sold under brands such as Spicetec Flavors \\& Seasonings ${ }^{\\circledR}$. The Spicetec and JM Swank businesses were sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. These businesses comprised the entire Commercial segment following the presentation of Lamb Weston as discontinued operations.\n\n## Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) from Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results\n\nDerivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately.\n\nThe following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions associated with continuing operations, under this methodology:\n\n| (\\$ in millions) | Fiscal Years Ended |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { May 26, } \\\\ 2019 \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { May 27, } \\\\ 2018 \\end{gathered}$ | $\\begin{gathered} \\text { May 28, } \\\\ 2017 \\end{gathered}$ |\n| Net derivative gains (losses) incurred. | \\$ (3.6) | \\$ (0.9) | \\$ 0.6 |\n| Less: Net derivative gains (losses) allocated to reporting segments | (1.8) | (7.1) | 5.7 |\n| Net derivative gains (losses) recognized in general corporate expenses. | \\$ (1.8) | 6.2 | \\$ (5.1) |\n| Net derivative gains (losses) allocated to Grocery \\& Snacks. | \\$ (2.1) | 0.2 | 3.4 |\n| Net derivative gains (losses) allocated to Refrigerated \\& Frozen | (1.1) | (0.3) | 0.8 |\n| Net derivative gains (losses) allocated to International Foods | 2.8 | (6.9) | 1.6 |\n| Net derivative losses allocated to Foodservice. | (0.6) | (0.1) | \u2014 |\n| Net derivative losses allocated to Pinnacle Foods | (0.8) | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| Net derivative losses allocated to Commercial. | \u2014 | \u2014 | (0.1) |\n| Net derivative gains (losses) included in segment operating profit | \\$ (1.8) | (7.1) | \\$ 5.7 |\n\nAs of May 26, 2019, the cumulative amount of net derivative gains from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and not yet allocated to reporting segments was $\\$ 1.4$ million. This amount reflected net gains of $\\$ 1.0$ million incurred during the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019, as well as net gains of $\\$ 0.4$ million incurred prior to fiscal 2019. Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify to segment operating results gains of $\\$ 0.9$ million in fiscal 2020 and $\\$ 0.5$ million in fiscal 2021 and thereafter."

Sales of DRAM products for 2019 decreased $28 \\%$ as compared to 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices of approximately $30 \\%$ resulting from supply and demand imbalances, customer inventory corrections, and CPU shortages. Sales of NAND products for 2019 decreased 12\\% as compared to 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices in the mid- $40 \\%$ range resulting from supply and demand imbalances, which were partially offset by significant increases in sales volumes. In addition, demand for our NAND products was adversely affected by the transition from SATA SSDs to NVMe SSDs. The higher NAND sales volumes in 2019 were driven by increases in sales of high-value mobile managed NAND products as well as discrete NAND products enabled by our execution in ramping 64- and 96-layer TLC 3D NAND.\n\nTotal revenue for 2018 increased 50\\% as compared to 2017. Higher revenue in 2018 for both DRAM and NAND as compared to 2017 were driven by strong execution in delivering high-value products featuring our 1Xnm DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND technologies combined with strong demand for products across our primary markets. Sales of DRAM products for 2018 increased $64 \\%$ from 2017 primarily due to an increase in average selling prices of approximately $35 \\%$ and an increase in sales volumes of approximately $20 \\%$ as a result of strong market conditions, particularly for cloud, enterprise, mobile, and graphics markets, combined with increased sales into high-value markets. Sales of NAND products for 2018 increased 20\\% from 2017 despite declines in average selling prices primarily due to an increase in sales volumes of approximately $30 \\%$ driven by increases in sales of high-value SSD and mobile managed NAND products enabled by strong demand and our execution in delivering 3D NAND products.\n\n## Overall Gross Margin\n\nOur overall gross margin percentage decreased to $46 \\%$ for 2019 from $59 \\%$ for 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by cost reductions resulting from strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies and from continuous improvement initiatives to reduce production costs. Underutilization of IMFT assets adversely impacted our gross margin by a per-quarter average of approximately $\\$ 100$ million in 2019 and $\\$ 65$ million in 2018, and we anticipate the adverse impact of underutilization at IMFT to increase to approximately $\\$ 150$ million per quarter beginning in the first quarter of 2020 ."

        "text": "# Table of Contents \n\nHistorically, a small number of OEM customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our net revenues, and we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. Many of our OEMs use contract manufacturers to manufacture their equipment. Accordingly, a significant percentage of our net revenues is derived from sales to these contract manufacturers and to consignment warehouses. In addition, a significant portion of our sales are made to foreign and domestic distributors who resell our products to OEMs, as well as their contract manufacturers. Direct sales to contract manufacturers and consignment warehouses accounted for $41.3 \\%, 34.9 \\%$ and $39.0 \\%$ of our net revenues for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales to foreign and domestic distributors accounted for $56.0 \\%, 62.5 \\%$ and $57.5 \\%$ of our net revenues for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The following direct customers accounted for $10 \\%$ or more of our net revenues in one or more of the following periods:\n\n|  | Fiscal Year Ended |  |  |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | March 31, |  |  |\n| Contract manufacturers and consignment warehouses: | $\\mathbf{2 0 1 9}$ | $\\mathbf{2 0 1 8}$ | $\\mathbf{2 0 1 7}$ |\n| Flextronics Technology |  |  |  |\n| Sanmina | $21.8 \\%$ | $14.0 \\%$ | $10.4 \\%$ |\n| Distributors: |  |  |  |\n| Avnet Logistics | 17.7 | 16.0 | 20.4 |\n| Nexcomm |  |  |  |\n\nNokia was our largest customer in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017. Nokia purchases products directly from us and through contract manufacturers and distributors. Based on information provided to us by its contract manufacturers and our distributors, purchases by Nokia represented approximately $45 \\%, 36 \\%$ and $41 \\%$ of our net revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our revenues have been substantially impacted by significant fluctuations in sales to Nokia, and we expect that future direct and indirect sales to Nokia will continue to fluctuate substantially on a quarterly basis and that such fluctuations may significantly affect our operating results in future periods. To our knowledge, none of our other OEM customers accounted for more than $10 \\%$ of our net revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017.\n\nCost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of wafer fabrication costs, wafer sort, assembly, test and burn-in expenses, the amortized cost of production mask sets, stock-based compensation and the cost of materials and overhead from operations. All of our wafer manufacturing and assembly operations, and a significant portion of our wafer sort testing operations, are outsourced. Accordingly, most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to TSMC, Powerchip and independent assembly and test houses. Because we do not have long-term, fixed-price supply contracts, our wafer fabrication and other outsourced manufacturing costs are subject to the cyclical fluctuations in demand for semiconductors. Cost of revenues also includes expenses related to supply chain management, quality assurance, and final product testing and documentation control activities conducted at our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California and our branch operations in Taiwan.\n\nGross Profit. Our gross profit margins vary among our products and are generally greater on our higher density products and, within a particular density, greater on our higher speed and industrial temperature products. We expect that our overall gross margins will fluctuate from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix, changes in average selling prices and our ability to control our cost of revenues, including costs associated with outsourced wafer fabrication and product assembly and testing.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers and other technical personnel, the cost of developing prototypes, stock-based compensation and fees paid to consultants. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred. We charge mask costs used in production to cost of revenues over a 12-month period. However, we charge costs related to pre-production mask sets, which are not used in production, to research and development expenses at"

The impact of the true up of the estimates is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the period in which the revision is determined.

The main term of the warranty period is one year. The Company accrues for the estimated cost of the warranty on its products shipped in the provision for warranty, upon recognition of the sale of the product. The costs are estimated based on actual historical expenses incurred and on estimated future expenses related to current sales, and are updated periodically. Actual warranty costs are charged against the provision for warranty.\n\n## NOTE 15.

Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.\n\n|  All figures in USD except number of shares and earnings (loss) per common share | 2019 | 2018 | 2017  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Numerator: |  |  |   |\n|  Net Loss | $(10,352)$ | $(95,306)$ | $(204,969)$  |\n|  Denominator: |  |  |   |\n|  Basic - Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding | $142,571,361$ | $141,969,666$ | $103,832,680$  |\n|  Dilutive - Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding | $142,571,361$ | $141,969,666$ | $103,832,680$  |\n|  Loss per Common Share: |  |  |   |\n|  Basic | $(0.07)$ | $(0.67)$ | $(1.97)$  |\n|  Diluted | $(0.07)$ | $(0.67)$ | $(1.97)$  |\n\nOn March 29, 2019, the Company launched an ATM program of our common shares for up to $\\$ 40.0$ million. The Company has issued 5,260,968 shares with net proceeds of $\\$ 17.9$ million under its At-the-Market as of December 31, 2019. The Company has not issued any shares subsequent to the balance sheet date.\n\nThe remaining available proceeds through the offering is $\\$ 21.4$ million as of the date of this report. Based on the share price of the Company of $\\$ 3.47$ per share as of April 3, 2020 it would have resulted in $6,173,500$ new shares being issued, if fully utilizing the remaining balance available through the ATM."

        "text": "accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both onpremises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n\nJ udgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\n\n# Contract Balances \n\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nAs of J une 30, 2019 and 2018, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $\\$ 2.2$ billion and $\\$ 1.8$ billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.\n\nActivity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\n(In millions)\n\n| Year Ended J une 30, | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |\n| :-- | --: | --: | --: |\n| Balance, beginning of period | $\\mathbf{\\$ 3 9 7}$ | $\\$ 361$ | $\\$ 409$ |\n| Charged to costs and other | 153 | 134 | 58 |\n| Write-offs | $(116)$ | $(98)$ | $(106)$ |\n| Balance, end of period | $\\mathbf{\\$ 4 3 4}$ | $\\$ 397$ | $\\$ 361$ |"

        "text": "We derive a significant percentage of our revenue from a small number of large customers. The ten largest customers accounted for approximately $82.2 \\%$ of net sales in 2019 (2018: 79.2\\%). The three largest customers accounted for approximately $61.6 \\%$ of net sales in 2019 excluding the proceeds of the patent litigation and arbitration settlement (2018: 51.5\\%). In 2019 we had three customers (2018: two customers) who contributed more than $10 \\%$ of total net sales. Sales to these large customers also may fluctuate significantly from time to time depending on the timing and level of purchases by these customers. Significant orders from such customers may expose the Company to a concentration of credit risk and difficulties in collecting amounts due, which could harm the Company's financial results.\n\nWe invest our cash and cash equivalents in short-term deposits, money market funds and derivative instruments with high-rated financial institutions. We only enter into transactions with a limited number of major financial institutions that have high credit ratings and we closely monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties. Concentration risk is mitigated by not limiting the exposure to a single counter party.\n\nThe maximum credit exposure is equal to the carrying values of cash and cash equivalent, and accounts receivable.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nOur policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.\n\nOur liquidity needs are affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal on-going operations of the business, and others that relate to the uncertainties of the global economy and the semiconductor industry. Although our cash requirements fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with our principal sources of liquidity are sufficient to satisfy our current requirements, including our expected capital expenditures in 2020.\n\nWe intend to return cash to our shareholders on a regular basis in the form of dividend payments and, subject to our actual and anticipated liquidity requirements and other relevant factors, share buybacks.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contractual and other obligations as at December 31, 2019.\n\n|   | Total | Less than\n1 year | 1-5 years | More than\n5 years  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Accounts payable | 119,712 | 119,712 | - | -  |\n|  Income tax payable | 34,599 | 34,599 | - | -  |\n|  Accrued expenses and other payables | 149,843 | 149,843 | - | -  |\n|  Lease liabilities | 24,261 | 6,977 | 14,726 | 2,558  |\n|  Pension liabilities | 7,734 | 333 | 2,544 | 4,857  |\n|  Purchase obligations: |  |  |  |   |\n|  Purchase commitments to suppliers | 100,694 | 99,546 | 1,148 | -  |\n|  Capital expenditure and other commitments | 43,692 | 40,745 | 2,947 | -  |\n|  Total contractual obligations | 480,535 | 451,755 | 21,365 | 7,415  |\n\nTotal short-term lines of credit amounted to $\u20ac 150$ million at December 31, 2019. The amount outstanding at December 31, 2019 was nil and the undrawn portion totaled $\u20ac 150$ million. The standby revolving credit facility of $\u20ac 150$ million with a consortium of banks will be available through December 16, 2023.\n\nFor the majority of purchase commitments, the Company has flexible delivery schedules depending on the market conditions, which allows the Company, to a certain extent, to delay delivery beyond originally planned delivery schedules.\n\n## Equity price risk\n\nThe shares of ASMPT, our 25.19\\% equity investment, are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. If the fair value of an investment is less than its carrying value at the balance sheet date, the Company determines whether the impairment is temporary or prolonged. The amount per share recognized as per December 31, 2019 under equity accounting amounts to HK\\$66.09 whereas the level 1 fair value per share (being the market price of a share on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange) was HK\\$108.10. Management concluded that, based on quantitative analysis no impairment of its share in ASMPT existed as per December 31, 2019."

FEI-Asia was sold for $130,000 in addition to all rights, benefits and obligations attached thereto, free and clear from any encumbrance. The results of this transaction, including approximately $85,000 of income for the twenty-one days in May 2019, are included in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019. The above transaction resulted in a consolidated loss of approximately $1 million.\n\n### 4.

For contracts that include renewal provisions, revenue is recognized up-front upon satisfaction of the associated performance obligations, but payments are received upon renewal. Renewals occur in bi-annual and annual increments over the associated expected contract term, the majority of which range from two to five years. The Company's contracts with customers under multi-year arrangements generally have three-year terms and are invoiced annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. The Company records a receivable related to revenue recognized under multi-year arrangements as the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to these arrangements.\n\nWhere the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing and payment, the Company has determined that its contracts do not include a significant financing component. A substantial amount of the consideration promised by the customer under the contracts that include renewal provisions is variable, and the amount and timing of that consideration varies based on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events that are not substantially within the Company's control. With respect to multi-year year arrangements, there is minimal difference between the consideration received and the cash selling price, any offered discounts are driven by volume, and the contracts are of short duration resulting in insignificant interest. Thus, the primary purpose of the invoicing terms on the multi-year arrangements is to provide the customer with a simplified and predictable way of purchasing certain products, not to provide financing or to receive financing from the Company's customer."

Expected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligations at September 29, 2019 and include estimated future employee service, if applicable.\n\n## 13. SHARE-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION\n\nStock incentive plans - We offer share-based compensation plans to attract, retain, and motivate key officers, employees, and non-employee directors to work toward the financial success of the Company.\n\nOur stock incentive plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and have been approved by the stockholders of the Company. The terms and conditions of our share-based awards are determined by the Compensation Committee for each award date and may include provisions for the exercise price, expirations, vesting, restriction on sales, and forfeitures, as applicable. We issue new shares to satisfy stock issuances under our stock incentive plans.\n\nOur Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 11,600,000 common shares in connection with the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted stock bonuses, restricted stock units, or performance units to key employees, directors, and other designated employees. There were 1,677,983 shares of common stock available for future issuance under this plan as of September 29, 2019.\n\nWe also maintain a deferred compensation plan for non-management directors under which those who are eligible to receive fees or retainers may choose to defer receipt of their compensation. The deferred amounts are converted to stock equivalents. The plan requires settlement in shares of our common stock based on the number of stock equivalents and dividend equivalents at the time of a participant's separation from the Board of Directors. This plan provides for the issuance of up to 350,000 shares of common stock in connection with the crediting of stock equivalents. There werd 43,122 shares of common stock available for future issuance under this plan as of September 29, 2019.\n\nCompensation expense - The components of share-based compensation expense, included within \"Selling, general, and administrative expenses\" in our consolidated statement of earnings, in each fiscal year are as follows (in thousands):\n\n|   | 2019 | 2018 | 2017  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Nonvested stock units | $\\$ 5,458$ | $\\$ 5,737$ | $\\$ 5,873$  |\n|  Stock options | 936 | 1,790 | 1,826  |\n|  Performance share awards | 1,417 | 1,236 | 2,580  |\n|  Nonvested restricted stock awards | - | 33 | 88  |\n|  Non-management directors' deferred compensation | 263 | 350 | 270  |\n|  Total share-based compensation expense | $\\$ 8,074$ | $\\$ 9,146$ | $\\$ 10,637$  |\n\nNonvested restricted stock units - Nonvested restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") are generally issued to executives, non-management directors and certain other members of management and employees. Prior to fiscal 2011, RSUs were granted to certain Executive and Senior Vice Presidents pursuant to our share ownership guidelines. These awards vest upon retirement or termination based on years of service. There were 60,272 of such RSUs outstanding as of September 29, 2019."

        "text": "# TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn 2019 and 2018, we had pre-tax losses of $\\$ 19,573$ and $\\$ 25,403$ respectively, which are available for carry forward to offset future taxable income. We made determinations to provide full valuation allowances for our net deferred tax assets at the end of 2019 and 2018, including NOL carryforwards generated during the years, based on our evaluation of positive and negative evidence, including our history of operating losses and the uncertainty of generating future taxable income that would enable us to realize our deferred tax assets.\n\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities) consist of the following:\n\n|   | As of December 31, 2019 | As of December 31, 2018  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Deferred tax assets: |  |   |\n|  Reserves and accruals | \\$ 62 | \\$ 45  |\n|  Research and development credits and other credits | 1,730 | 1,635  |\n|  Net operating loss carry forward | 27,907 | 25,733  |\n|  Stock based compensation | 8,402 | 8,857  |\n|  Other | 11 | 26  |\n|  Total deferred tax assets | 38,112 | 36,296  |\n|  Valuation allowance | $(38,112)$ | $(36,296)$  |\n|  Deferred tax assets after valuation allowance | - | -  |\n|  Total deferred tax liability | - | -  |\n|  Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) | \\$ | \\$  |\n\nIn assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that a portion of the net deferred assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Based on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019 will not be realizable. Accordingly, management has maintained a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the 12 months ended December 31, 2019 was an increase of $\\$ 1,816$.\n\nAt December 31, 2019, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\\$ 131,055$ and $\\$ 107,989$, respectively, expiring beginning in 2028 for federal and in 2029 for state, respectively. At December 31, 2019, we had federal research and development creditcarryforwards of approximately $\\$ 1,730$, expiring beginning in 2032.\n\nInternal Revenue Code Section 382 places a limitation (the \"Section 382 Limitation\") on the amount of net operating loss carry forwards that can be used to offset taxable income after a change in control (generally greater than $50 \\%$ change in ownership) of a loss corporation. California, the state in which our headquarters was once located, has similar rules. Our capitalization may have resulted in such a change. Generally, after a control change, a loss corporation cannot deduct net operating loss carry forwards generated in years prior to the deemed change of control under IRC Section 382 in excess of the Section 382 Limitation.\n\nWe are required to recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. As a result, we have provided an allowance for an uncertain tax position under ASC 740-10 of $\\$ 0$ and $\\$ 316$ at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. In 2019, we released all ASC 740-10 uncertain tax positions due to the expiring of the statute of limitation.\n\nOur tax returns are subject to review by various tax authorities. The returns subject to review are those from 2005 forward. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties, if any, accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits, as a component of income tax expense. We had no interest or penalties accrued for the year ended December 31, 2019."

This was partially offset by lower depreciation as a result of a write-down of the unit in the third quarter of 2019.\n\n\n# Teekay Parent - Other and Corporate G\\&A \n\nLoss from vessel operations for Other and Corporate G\\&A was $\\$ 10.9$ million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to loss from vessel operations of $\\$ 14.4$ million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in corporate expenses and the redelivery of the two in-chartered LNG carriers to Teekay LNG in 2018, partially offset by the termination of certain contracts for managing drybulk vessels.\n\n## Teekay Parent - Equity Income\n\nEquity income was $\\$ 0.1$ million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to equity income of $\\$ 13.2$ million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was primarily due to the sale of Teekay Parent's 43.5\\% ownership interest in Magnora ASA (or Magnora) in November 2018.\n\n## Equity-Accounted Investment in Altera\n\n## Recent Developments in Altera\n\nIn May 2019, we sold to Brookfield all of our remaining interests in Altera, which included our 49\\% general partner interest, common units, warrants, and an outstanding $\\$ 25$ million loan from us to Altera, for total proceeds of $\\$ 100$ million.\nPrior to the sale in May 2019 of our remaining interests in Altera to Brookfield, we accounted for our investment in Altera's general partner and common units using the equity method. We recognized equity losses from Altera of $\\$ 75.8$ million for the year ended December 31, 2019 ( $\\$ 6.9$ million - year ended December 31, 2018). Included in that amount for 2019 was a write-down of our investment in Altera of $\\$ 64.9$ million and a loss on sale of Altera of $\\$ 8.9$ million. The equity loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes our proportionate share of write-downs of two of Altera's FPSO units totaling $\\$ 9.4$ million and gains on Altera's settlement with Petrobras in relation to the previouslyterminated charter contracts of the HiLoad DP unit and Arendal Spirit UMS of $\\$ 12.9$ million.\n\n## Other Consolidated Operating Results\n\nThe following table compares our other consolidated operating results for 2019 and 2018:\n\n|  | Year Ended December 31, |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except percentages) | 2019 | 2018  |\n|  Interest expense | $(279,059)$ | $(254,126)$  |\n|  Interest income | 7,804 | 8,525  |\n|  Realized and unrealized losses on non-designated derivative instruments | $(13,719)$ | $(14,852)$  |\n|  Foreign exchange (loss) gain | $(13,574)$ | 6,140  |\n|  Loss on deconsolidation of Altera | - | $(7,070)$  |\n|  Other loss | $(14,475)$ | $(2,013)$  |\n|  Income tax expense | $(25,482)$ | $(19,724)$  |\n\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased to $\\$ 279.1$ million in 2019, compared to $\\$ 254.1$ million in 2018, primarily due to:\n\n- an increase of $\\$ 29.9$ million primarily to the commencement of Teekay LNG's finance lease obligations upon the deliveries of the Myrina, Megara and Yamal Spirit LNG carriers and an increase in debt balance to pay for the final newbuilding installments on the Bahrain Spirit and Sean Spirit LNG carrier newbuilding deliveries;\n- an increase of $\\$ 6.7$ million primarily due to the additional interest expense incurred by Teekay Tankers with respect to three sale-leaseback financing transactions completed in September 2018, November 2018 and May 2019; and\n- an increase of $\\$ 6.3$ million due to decreases in capitalized interest in Teekay LNG in 2019 as a result of vessels delivered during 2018 and 2019 ;\npartially offset by\n- net decrease of $\\$ 13.8$ million as a result of the repurchase of the $8.5 \\%$ senior notes (or the 2020 Notes), partially offset by an increase in debt issuance cost amortization and the higher interest rate for the $9.25 \\%$ senior secured notes due November 2022 (or the 2022 Notes) issued by Teekay Parent in May 2019 (please read \"Item 18 - Financial Statements: Note 9 - Long-Term Debt\"); and"

The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $300,000, which may be increased by $150,000 at the request of the Company, subject to the administrative agent's approval. This new unsecured credit facility replaces the prior $300,000 unsecured credit facility, which would have expired August 10, 2020. Borrowings of $50,000 under the prior credit agreement were refinanced into the Credit Agreement. The prior agreement was terminated as of February 12, 2019.\n\nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes a swing line sublimit of $15,000 and a letter of credit sublimit of $10,000. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the base rate defined in the Credit Agreement. We also pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee ranges from 0.20% to 0.30% based on our total leverage ratio.\n\nThe Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that we comply with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Failure to comply with these covenants could reduce the borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2019. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that we deliver quarterly financial statements, annual financial statements, auditor certifications, and compliance certificates within a specified number of days after the end of a quarter and year. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictions limiting our ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates; and make stock repurchases and dividend payments. Interest rates on the Revolving Credit Facility fluctuate based upon the LIBOR and the Company\u2019s quarterly total leverage ratio.\n\nWe have debt issuance costs related to our long-term debt that are being amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the debt. Amortization expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $163 and $185 in 2018 and 2017. These costs are included in interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\n\nWe use interest rate swaps to convert the revolving credit facility's variable rate of interest into a fixed rate on a portion of the debt as described more fully in Note 13 \"Derivatives.\" These swaps are treated as cash flow hedges and consequently, the changes in fair value were recorded in other comprehensive earnings."

        "text": "Assembly and Testing. We offer our customers turnkey services by providing the option to purchase finished semiconductor products that have been assembled and tested. We outsource assembly and test services to leading assembly and test service providers, including Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd., or Siliconware, and Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc. in Taiwan. After final testing, the semiconductors are shipped to our customers' designated locations.\n\nIn addition to our foundry business, we also engage in the research, development and manufacture of products in the solar energy and LED industries.\n\n# Customers and Markets \n\nOur primary customers, in terms of our sales revenues, include premier integrated device manufacturers, such as Texas Instruments and Intel Mobile, plus leading fabless design companies, such as Broadcom, MediaTek, Realtek, Qualcomm and Novatek. Although we are not dependent on any single customer, a significant portion of our operating revenues has been generated from sales to a few customers. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately $51.3 \\%$ of our operating revenues in 2019. Set forth below is a geographic breakdown of our operating revenues in 2017, 2018 and 2019 by the location of our customers.\n\n|  | Years Ended December 31, |  |  |\n| :-- | --: | --: | --: |\n| Region | $\\mathbf{2 0 1 7}$ | $\\mathbf{2 0 1 8}$ | $\\mathbf{2 0 1 9}$ |\n| Taiwan | $\\%$ | $\\%$ | $\\%$ |\n| Singapore | 32.8 | 36.4 | 36.4 |\n| China (including Hong Kong) | 20.6 | 16.4 | 16.2 |\n| Japan | 12.7 | 12.2 | 12.9 |\n| USA | 3.2 | 3.9 | 6.6 |\n| Europe | 12.2 | 15.6 | 13.5 |\n| Others | 9.6 | 8.3 | 4.7 |\n| Total | $\\mathbf{1 0 0 . 0}$ | $\\mathbf{1 0 0 . 0}$ | $\\mathbf{1 0 0 . 0}$ |\n\nWe believe our success in attracting these end customers is a direct result of our commitment to high quality service and our intense focus on customer needs and performance. As an independent semiconductor foundry, most of our operating revenue is generated by our sales of wafers. The following table presented the percentages of our wafer sales by types of customers for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n\n|  | Years Ended December 31, |  |  |\n| :-- | --: | --: | --: |\n| Customer Type | $\\mathbf{2 0 1 7}$ | $\\mathbf{2 0 1 8}$ | $\\mathbf{2 0 1 9}$ |\n|  | $\\%$ | $\\%$ | $\\%$ |\n| Fabless design companies | 91.0 | 92.4 | 91.3 |\n| Integrated device manufacturers | 9.0 | 7.6 | 8.7 |\n| Total | $\\mathbf{1 0 0 . 0}$ | $\\mathbf{1 0 0 . 0}$ | $\\mathbf{1 0 0 . 0}$ |\n\nWe focus on providing a high level of customer service in order to attract customers and maintain their ongoing loyalty. Our culture emphasizes responsiveness to customer needs with a focus on flexibility, speed and accuracy throughout our manufacturing and delivery processes. Our customeroriented approach is especially evident in two types of services: customer design development services and manufacturing services. For example, in 2013, we expand our regional business by opening our UMC Korea office, in order to provide local support to our customers in Korea, and shorten time-to-market for our Korea-based customers designing and manufacturing on UMC process technologies. We believe that our large production capacity and advanced process technology enable us to provide better customer service than many other foundries through shorter turn-around time, greater manufacturing flexibility and higher manufacturing yields."

The overdraft facility acts as a secured loan under the terms of the Credit Agreement to provide an additional funding mechanism for timing differences that can occur in the bill payment settlement process. As of December 31, 2019, $138.5 million was available.Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. As of December 31, 2019, we had $121.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $49.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., we may potentially be required to pay foreign and U.S. state income taxes to repatriate these funds. As of December 31, 2019, only the earnings in our Indian foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested. The earnings of all other foreign entities are no longer indefinitely reinvested. We are also permanently reinvested for outside book/tax basis differences related to foreign subsidiaries.

Cash flows provided by operating activities were $46.3 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, due to the timing of working capital. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily for funding capital expenditures, lease payments, stock repurchases, and acquisitions. | |   |   |\n|  Cash Flow from Investing Activities |  |   |\n|  During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid $753.9 million, net of $0.1 million in cash acquired, to acquire Speedpay. We also used cash of $18.5 million to invest in a payment technology and services company in India and $7.0 million to acquire the technology assets of RevChip, LLC and TranSend Integrated Technologies Inc. In addition, we used cash of $48.0 million to purchase software, property and equipment, as compared to $43.9 million during the same period in 2018. | |   |   |\n|  Cash Flow from Financing Activities |  |   |\n|  Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, were $667.2 million, as compared to net cash flows used by financing activities of $57.7 million during the same period in 2018. During 2019, we received proceeds of $500.0 million from our Delayed Draw Term Loan and $280.0 million from our Revolving Credit Facility to fund our purchase of Speedpay and stock repurchases, and we repaid $28.9 million on the Initial Term Loan and $41.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility.

AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT \n\nOur board of directors has determined that Cheng-Li Huang and Wenyi Chu, two of our independent directors and members of the audit committee, qualify as audit committee financial experts as defined in Item 16A of Form 20-F and are independent in accordance with the applicable requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requirement.\n\nThe U.S. SEC has indicated that the designation of Dr. Huang and Dr. Chu as the audit committee financial experts does not: (i) make Dr. Huang or Dr. Chu an \"expert\" for any purpose, including without limitation for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as a result of this designation; (ii) impose any duties, obligations or liability on Dr. Huang or Dr. Chu that are greater than those imposed on them as a member of the audit committee and our board of directors in the absence of such designation; or (iii) affect the duties, obligations or liability of any other member of the audit committee or our board of directors.\n\n## ITEM 16B. CODE OF ETHICS\n\nWe amended the Code of Ethics for Directors and Officers in November 2017, and the Employee Code of Conduct in February 2020. The Employee Code of Conduct, which is applicable to all employees, replaced the code of ethics filed with the U.S. SEC in our 2003 annual report on Form 20-F. We have also created a separate code of ethics applicable to our directors and officers. A copy of each of the Code of Ethics for Directors and Officers and the Employee Code of Conduct are displayed on our website at http://www.umc.com/english/pdf/Code of Ethics.pdf and http://www.umc.com/english/pdf/Code of Conduct.pdf, respectively.

        "text": "# Infrastructure Platforms\n\nThe Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and the data center. Infrastructure Platforms revenue increased by $7 \\%$, or $\\$ 1,869$ million, with growth across the portfolio. Switching had solid growth, with strong revenue growth in campus switching driven by an increase in sales of our intent-based networking Catalyst 9000 Series, and with growth in data center switching driven by increased revenue from our ACI portfolio. Routing experienced modest revenue growth driven by an increase in sales of SD-WAN products, partially offset by weakness in the service provider market. We experienced double digit revenue growth from wireless products driven by increases across the portfolio. Revenue from data center increased driven by higher sales of HyperFlex and our server products.\n\n## Applications\n\nThe Applications product category includes our collaboration offerings (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence and conferencing) as well as IoT and AppDynamics analytics software offerings. Revenue in our Applications product category increased by $15 \\%$, or $\\$ 767$ million, with double digit growth in unified communications, TelePresence, AppDynamics, and IoT software.\n\n## Security\n\nRevenue in our Security product category increased $16 \\%$, or $\\$ 378$ million, driven by higher sales of identity and access, advanced threat security, unified threat management and web security products. The Duo acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 also contributed to the revenue increase in this product category.\n\n## Other Products\n\nThe decrease in revenue from our Other Products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from SPVSS business which we divested on October 28, 2018.\n\n## Service Revenue by Segment\n\nThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):\n\n|  Years Ended | Years Ended |  |  | 2019 vs. 2018 |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | July 27, 2019 | July 28, 2018 | July 29, 2017 | Variance in Dollars | Variance in Percent  |\n|  Service revenue: |  |  |  |  |   |\n|  Americas | \\$ 8,173 | \\$ 7,982 | \\$ 7,864 | \\$ 191 | $2 \\%$  |\n|  Percentage of service revenue | 63.4\\% | 63.3\\% | 63.9\\% |  |   |\n|  EMEA | 2,854 | 2,754 | 2,635 | 100 | $4 \\%$  |\n|  Percentage of service revenue | 22.1\\% | 21.8\\% | 21.4\\% |  |   |\n|  APJC. | 1,872 | 1,885 | 1,801 | (13) | $(1) \\%$  |\n|  Percentage of service revenue | 14.5\\% | 14.9\\% | 14.7\\% |  |   |\n|  Total | \\$ 12,899 | \\$ 12,621 | \\$ 12,300 | \\$ 278 | $2 \\%$  |\n\nAmounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.

This guidance requires that changes in fair value of equity securities be accounted for directly in earnings. Previously, the changes in fair value were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. Teradyne continues to record realized gains in interest income and realized losses in interest expense. The adoption of this new accounting guidance increased the January 1, 2018 retained earnings balance by $\\$ 3.1$ million and decreased the accumulated other comprehensive income balance by the same amount.\n\n## Investment in Other Company\n\nTeradyne holds an investment in a private company that develops and sells advanced wearable technology. Teradyne does not have the ability to exert significant influence over the company. The investment was recorded at cost and is evaluated for impairment or an indication of changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer on a quarterly basis. See Note D: \"Acquisitions and Investment in Other Company.\"\n\n## Prepayments\n\nPrepayments consist of the following and are included in prepayments and other current assets on the balance sheet:\n\n|  | 2019 | 2018 |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | (in thousands) |  |\n| Contract manufacturer and supplier prepayments | \\$143,392 | \\$131,642 |\n| Prepaid taxes | 8,046 | 9,646 |\n| Prepaid maintenance and other services | 8,503 | 8,487 |\n| Other prepayments | 16,753 | 12,744 |\n| Total prepayments | \\$176,694 | \\$162,519 |\n\n## Retirement and Postretirement Plans\n\nTeradyne recognizes net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in its operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. Teradyne calculates the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of December 31 and, accordingly, recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans.\n\n## Retirement Benefits\n\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, \"Compensation\u2014Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.\" Teradyne retrospectively adopted the new accounting guidance on presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs in the first quarter of 2018. This guidance requires the service cost component of net benefit costs to be reported in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations as other employee compensation costs. The non-service components of net benefit costs such as interest cost, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service cost, and actuarial gains or losses, are required to be reported separately outside of income or loss from operations. Following the adoption of this guidance, Teradyne continues to record the service cost component in the same line item as other employee"

As of August 31, 2019, we had up to $\\$ 1.5$ billion in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable sale programs.\n\n# Capital Expenditures \n\nFor fiscal year 2020, we anticipate our net capital expenditures will be approximately $\\$ 800.0$ million. Our capital expenditures will support ongoing maintenance in our DMS and EMS segments and investments in new markets. The amount of actual capital expenditures may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things.\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated cash flow information (in thousands):\n\n|  | Fiscal Year Ended August 31, |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities | \\$1,193,066 | $\\$ (1,105,448)$ | $\\$(1,464,085)$ |\n| Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities | $(872,454)$ | 1,240,914 | 2,141,263 |\n| Net cash used in financing activities | $(415,772)$ | $(47,044)$ | $(404,546)$ |\n| Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents | 554 | $(20,392)$ | 5,228 |\n| Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents | $\\$(94,606)$ | \\$ 68,030 | \\$ 277,860 |\n\n## Operating Activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 was primarily due to increased accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, decreased inventories and non-cash expenses, partially offset by increased contract assets and accounts receivable. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to the timing of collections on accounts receivable sold under the securitization programs and the timing of purchases and cash payments. The decrease in inventories is primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and the reclassification to contract assets for revenue recognized for over time customers, partially offset by an increase in inventories to support expected sales levels in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The increase in contract assets is due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and the timing of revenue recognition for over time customers. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily driven by the amended and new securitization programs and higher sales and timing of collections.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures principally to support ongoing business in the DMS and EMS segments and expenditures for assets acquired in connection with the initial and second closings of the acquisition of certain assets of JJMD, partially offset by proceeds and advances from the sale of property, plant and equipment and cash receipts on sold receivables under the asset-backed securitization programs.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 was primarily due to: (i) payments for debt agreements, (ii) the repurchase of our common stock, (iii) dividend payments and (iv) treasury stock minimum tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock.

        "text": "# INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) \n\n## Operating Expenses.\n\nSelling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased \\$124.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018. Our selling and administrative expenses by major expense type for 2019 and 2018 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n|  | 2019 | 2018 | Change |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Personnel costs, including teammate benefits ............ | \\$ 684,837 | \\$ 593,955 | \\$ 90,882 |\n| Depreciation and amortization .............................. | 46,209 | 37,458 | 8,751 |\n| Facility expenses ................................................ | 30,945 | 26,396 | 4,549 |\n| Travel and entertainment...................................... | 28,402 | 25,656 | 2,746 |\n| Legal and professional fees ................................... | 16,839 | 16,103 | 736 |\n| Marketing .......................................................... | 11,597 | 10,345 | 1,252 |\n| Other .............................................................. | 61,908 | 46,616 | 15,292 |\n| Total .............................................................. | \\$ 880,737 | \\$ 756,529 | \\$ 124,208 |\n| Percentage of net sales........................................ | $11.4 \\%$ | $10.7 \\%$ |  |\n\nSelling and administrative expenses increased approximately 70 basis points as a percentage of net sales in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in expenses reflects the addition of PCM to our North America and EMEA segments, effective August 30, 2019. The addition of PCM and increased variable compensation resulting from increased sales and gross profit in 2019 compared to 2018 were the primary drivers for the $\\$ 90.9$ million increase in personnel costs. PCM was also the primary driver for year over year increases in facilities, travel and entertainment, and marketing expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $\\$ 8.8$ million year over year, primarily due to additional amortization expense on newly acquired intangible assets.\n\nSeverance and Restructuring Expenses. During 2019, we recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $\\$ 5.4$ million. The North America and EMEA charges related to severance actions taken to realign roles and responsibilities subsequent to the acquisition of PCM in August 2019, as well as a headcount reduction as part of cost reduction initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2019. For 2019, charges were partially offset by immaterial adjustments for changes in estimates of previous accruals as cash payments were made during the year. During 2018, we recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $\\$ 3.4$ million.\n\nAcquisition-related Expenses. During 2019, we incurred $\\$ 11.3$ million in direct third-party costs related to the acquisition of PCM. Comparatively, during 2018, we incurred \\$282,000 in such costs related to the acquisition of Cardinal. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of acquisitions.\n\n## Non-Operating (Income) Expense.\n\nInterest Expense, net. Interest expense, net primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and imputed interest under our convertible notes and inventory financing facilities, partially offset by interest income generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. Interest expense increased $30 \\%$, or $\\$ 6.8$ million, in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher average daily balances under our debt facilities, in 2019 compared to 2018, while imputed interest under our inventory financing facilities increased $\\$ 200,000$ to $\\$ 10.8$ million in 2019 and imputed interest under our convertible senior notes was $\\$ 3.7$ million in 2019.\n\nOther Expense (Income), Net. Other expense (income), net, consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The change in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses is due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities."

Pension plans covering salaried employees provide pension benefits that are based on the employees' years of service and compensation prior to retirement. Pension plans covering hourly employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service.\n\nWe also provide post-retirement life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. Domestic employees who were hired prior to 1982 and certain former union employees are eligible for life insurance benefits upon retirement. We fund life insurance benefits through term life insurance policies and intend to continue funding all of the premiums on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n\nWe recognize the funded status of a benefit plan in our consolidated balance sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation. We also recognize, as a component of other comprehensive earnings, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit/cost.\n\nThe measurement dates for the pension plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. locations were December 31, 2019, and 2018.\nDuring 2017, we offered certain former vested employees in our U.S. pension plan a one-time option to receive a lump sum distribution of their benefits from pension plan assets. The pension plan made approximately $\\$ 23,912$ in lump sum payments to settle its obligation to these participants. These settlement payments decreased the projected benefit obligation and plan assets by $\\$ 23,912$, and resulted in a non-cash settlement charge of $\\$ 13,476$ related to unrecognized net actuarial losses that were previously included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The measurement date of this settlement was December 31, 2017.\n\nIn February 2020, the CTS Board of Directors authorized and empowered management to explore termination of our U.S. based pension plans at management's discretion, subject to certain conditions. Management has not yet made a final decision on whether to pursue a plan termination and the potential timing thereof."
